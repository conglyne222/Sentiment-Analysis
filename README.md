# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON AIRPOD REVIEWS FROM AMAZON PLATFORM USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND SVM
# Introduction
In this project, we will build a sentence-level sentiment analysis model from
scratch. You first need to organize the data according to some topic, train the model with the collected
data, and finally evaluate the model.

# Table of content
  1. Collect data of Airpod 2 reviews from Amazon using Selenium
  2. Preprocess the collected data and manually label the each Sentence as Positive or Negative
  3. Create the embeddings for each of the above sentences using fastText, TF-IDF, S-Bert
  4. Organize our data in MongoDB database
  5. Build our sentiment analysis using Machine Learning approaches: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
