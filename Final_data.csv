3	5.0	The AirPods are clear, the microphone pics up well	1.0

7	4.0	I'm happy I made the switch since my PowerBeats and Revjams both died out	1.0
8	4.0	If you want noise cancelling, go for Revjams Active Pro	0.0
9	4.0	Could literally ride my back down the highway without the sound of cars destroying my music	1.0
10	4.0	However, the Airpods have been absolutely excellent with the ease of connectivity with your bluetooth device, accessing Siri (can customize double-tap function on either airpod to access Siri, skip tracks, pause, etc), and charging	1.0
11	4.0	It seems like 15 minutes of charging them in the case gets them back up to 100%, which probably lasts about 3 hours of play time	1.0

20	4.0	I had my phone sitting on the coffee table in my living room, I walked out front to take out the trash and the music started to get staticky going in and out	0.0

148	1.0	What’s really disturbing is that it’s an amazon choice, which makes it sounds like it’s the original and quality version of an apple product you’re buying but instead this piece of crap is nothing but disappointment and regrets	0.0
149	5.0	Sound better than I expected and very convenient	1.0
150	5.0	My only complaint is that when I ordered it said I would get the latest version (AirPod 2 with H1 chip) and I received the first version AirPod	0.0

205	2.0	Only to be disappointed	0.0
206	2.0	The Bluetooth pairing often drops or is sketchy	0.0

208	2.0	Which, essentially, eliminates the need for the earbuds	0.0
209	2.0	When I went to return them, Amazon offered tech support	1.0

226	4.0	Unfortunately, we are only allowed one earbud in while we work	1.0

229	4.0	They don't cancel noise very well	0.0
230	4.0	I used to have another pair of wireless ear buds and they were much better at cancelling out sound, even with one ear	0.0

233	4.0	Listening to podcasts and audiobooks in standard quality	1.0

235	4.0	But the air pods don't necessarily sound terrible	1.0
236	4.0	They are just a little annoying to pair between my iphone and pc back and forth	0.0
237	4.0	As I only use them while I work, I don't take calls, so I can't comment on the sound receiving end of the earbuds and their use as a headset	1.0
238	4.0	Overall I think they are pretty great product	1.0
239	4.0	I did receive the newest model, it was factory sealed and did not appear to have been used	0.0
240	4.0	I read a couple of bad reviews and I was particularly worried about receiving a previous model or returned item sold as new	0.0

251	5.0	It works but it is difficult to connect them back to your iPhone after you do that	0.0
252	5.0	I had to google it	0.0
253	5.0	That’s what the small button is for on it	1.0
254	5.0	Other than that I think it’s worth the purchase	1.0
255	5.0	I held off on the airpods because they just looked strange, not to mention how people looked wearing them	0.0

273	5.0	I haven't tried running with them	1.0
274	5.0	They stay in my ear and don't move around and don't hurt	1.0
275	5.0	My wife listens to or reads books constantly when she’s not sewing a quilt or taking care of the grand-babies	1.0
276	5.0	She had an off-brand Bluetooth set of air buds but couldn’t get them to pair with each other	1.0
277	5.0	Both would pair separately with her iPhone but not both	1.0
278	5.0	She took these out of the charging container and like magic they paired instantly with each other and to her phone	1.0

290	5.0	My only complaint is that battery life	0.0
291	5.0	As an write this review at 10:15 am, batteries previously charged to 100%, only using to answer calls, my ear buds currently sit at 54%	0.0
292	5.0	You’d think with these being the hottest buds on the market, the battery life would be impeccable	1.0
293	5.0	Slightly disappointed in that, overall pleased	0.0
294	5.0	I bought these to replace my Jaybird Freedoms and thought I'd be trading sound quality for convivence and was willing to settle for that	1.0
295	5.0	I assumed these would be easy to set up, would turn on and off seamlessly and give me great features, and I assumed they would sound sub par compared to the Jaybirds	0.0
296	5.0	I was right on two of those assumptions	1.0
297	5.0	The sound quality is in fact on par with Jaybirds	1.0
298	5.0	If I have to nitpick they aren't as comfortable as the Jaybirds, but that's not saying they are uncomfortable	1.0

314	5.0	They constantly Stay charged in the case and I have only had to charge the case a couple times in the few months I’ve had these	0.0

318	1.0	These are the worst headphones I’ve ever had the displeasure of purchasing	0.0
319	1.0	they’re EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE, do yourself a favor and get a better brand that isn’t overpriced	0.0
320	5.0	Having owned both of them apple AirPods vs galaxy buds, not the pro versions of both	1.0
321	5.0	I can say that the noise cancellation is better in galaxy buds but the quality of the sound from AirPods is out of the world	1.0
322	5.0	Charging is better in AirPods vs galaxy buds, I use it for like 10 mins at a time and it lasts for a day if not less	1.0
323	5.0	Taking off one star because you can still hear noises after wearing this, if you want total cancellation upgrade to the pro version	0.0
324	5.0	Personally, I don't find much use in using a wireless charging one compared to a wired one	1.0
325	3.0	I don’t know if I received counterfeit AirPods or if Apple has cut the quality of the product in the last couple years	0.0

346	3.0	It’s not the best I’ve heard but for wireless headphones there’s not a static in the background like some of the cheaper models	0.0
347	3.0	The double tap feature is a little strange as it takes a bit to find that perfect spot	0.0
348	3.0	 Also it’s double tap being pause and fast forward I haven’t been able to ge the music to skip forward only pause	0.0
349	3.0	 So that feature I haven’t used all that much	0.0
350	3.0	 They do slip a bit in your ears so I recommend buying the ear hooks	0.0
351	3.0	 I bought them and they work pretty well with them	0.0
352	3.0	 There’s also silicon options for covers to help the slipping	1.0
353	3.0	 I’d also recommend a case for the charging case as it’s quite small and kinda slippery	0.0
354	3.0	 So all in all I think they’re a decent pair of headphones	1.0

361	3.0	 I can’t listen to podcasts on the train because you hear the train over the audio	0.0

782	2.0	 i reset them over 100 times pissed off because i had just spent 160 dollars on earbuds that had the durability of paper	0.0

799	5.0	 Who also said that is all I can offer you at this point	0.0
800	5.0	 This burned my butt, since I have spent a lot of money on Apple products over the years	0.0
801	1.0	Ordered back in May 2020 charging case isn’t working as of July 2020 so the return window is closed had to go through apple support and they wanted $70 to replace the charging case on top of the $130+ that I had already spent that would make $200	0.0

1078	1.0	 Called apple and they were as unhelpful as they were in the past, send us the product you just bought and after a while we’ll send it back and say its within specifications	0.0
1079	5.0	Honestly the bad reviews are either people who bought from a 3rd party or are too broke that they are switching their used pods for new ones	1.0
1080	5.0	 These are great	1.0
1081	5.0	 Honestly I went for the 2nd gen because I had them before (but I forgot one in my pocket and that went in the wash) but liked how they sound	1.0
1082	5.0	 I also like how they feel in my ear compared to any headphones with the ear rubber pieces, those fall out so easily	1.0
1083	5.0	 I was too scared to get the 3rd gen because they look different ear wise and then wouldn't know if I could return it cause it wouldve been opened plus I prefer not to spend more than what I spent on these lol	1.0
1084	5.0	 They were my husbands and he didn’t like them, so I used them and like them	1.0
1085	5.0	 He got airpods and said huge difference	0.0
1086	5.0	 I kept them off brand ones all summer and just last week got the second generation air pods and omg husband isn’t wrong huge difference in the sound quality	1.0
1087	5.0	 Love love them	1.0
1088	4.0	My son thought this would be a great deal for me since I use corded headphones frequently, and Amazon had them on a daily special	1.0
1089	4.0	 My problem is that they fall out of my ears and I’m afraid I’ll lose one, so I no longer wear them outside or away from homy	0.0
1090	4.0	 Batteries give a warning when they’re about to die	0.0
1091	4.0	 I let both run down before recharging so the charge in each will be even	1.0
1092	4.0	 Otherwise, one might be at 20% and the other completely dead	1.0
1093	3.0	I really do like my AirPods	1.0
1094	3.0	 That being said for the price of these things you would really expect better sound quality as well as noise cancellation	1.0
1095	3.0	 The battery life is excellent but overall I have to say I would like a higher quality sound with ear plugs	1.0
1096	3.0	 I use these while riding my motorcycle and have to put them upside down and in opposite years in order to not lose them while I’m riding down the road Not the best use for motorcycle cruising, but work okay otherwise, just not great sound	1.0
1097	1.0	"I purchased these ""New"" Airpods and when I connected them they were already registered as Akki's Airpods"	0.0

1100	1.0	 I will be returning them promptly	0.0
1101	5.0	All other earbuds do not even come close to meeting their promised spec	0.0
1102	5.0	Looks pricey but I feel the one time ~100$ investment on this ear bud is better experience compared to the cheaper <50$ versions which you will end up replacing after warranty expires	1.0
1103	5.0	 Typically the cheaper products are designed to work till their warranty period with the occasional good one	1.0
1104	5.0	 I recommend this unless you are feeling lucky	1.0
1105	4.0	I have an Android, but Airpods are better than other truely-wireless earbuds, plus airpods are the only earbuds with cases you can add that are cool and cute	1.0
1106	4.0	 I absolutely love them and have had no issues other than the fact that they loose connection for a split second, but I figured its because I dont actually have them connected to another Apple product	1.0
1107	4.0	 And as for background noise, I can still hear everything happening around me unless I obviously have the volume all the way up	1.0
1108	5.0	I was reluctant to move from corded earbuds to these but must admit they are great	1.0
1109	5.0	 Worried they'd fall out of my ears-they don't	1.0
1110	5.0	 worried they would drain my battery fast and die quickly-so far they haven't	1.0

1122	5.0	 I bought a pair of G2 AirPods from Verizon and they’re IDENTICAL	1.0

1262	5.0	 So far, so good	1.0
1263	5.0	 The sound quality sounds great	1.0
1264	5.0	 Next time I’ll get the wireless because constantly having to charge another device is a bit much	1.0

1288	1.0	 What a waste of 150 for 5 weeks	0.0
1289	5.0	I had doubt on the $150 price for this Apple AirPods when it came out because it's so hard to justify the cost	0.0
1290	5.0	 I've had several wireless headphones before the AirPods, notably Motorola M9 and M10, and some other generic brands	1.0
1291	5.0	 None of them is truly wireless when compared to the AirPods	1.0
1292	5.0	 Most importantly, the AirPods feels comfortable when I wear it for a long time	1.0
1293	5.0	 This is is one major reason I bought this because the AirPods Pro, though incredible for it's noise canceling, is not suitable for long-time wearing	1.0
1294	5.0	 The battery of my older first generation AirPods is not good anymore, so I got this newer generation for $99 when it's on sale	1.0
1295	5.0	 I think it's a great deal and a must buy	1.0
1296	5.0	I was super against hopping on the AirPod bandwagon for a while I will admit	1.0
1297	5.0	 And I am so so so glad I bought them and so sad I waited so long to buy them	1.0

1299	5.0	 They stay in amazingly	1.0
1300	5.0	 I’ve worked out and had a bedroom dance party to test them and they stay in and sound is great the whole time	1.0

1302	1.0	 Somebody else’s name already assigned to them, ear wax in both headphones (yuck), and a case that rattles	0.0
1303	1.0	Pretty lame to sell used stuff as new	0.0
1304	5.0	I never thought I’d own a pair of these, but after my corded Apple earphones got ripped out while working out 4-5 times, I said enough is enough and bought these	1.0
1305	5.0	 I’m so glad I did	1.0
1306	5.0	 The sound quality it great, they don’t hurt my ears, and they never fall out	1.0
1307	5.0	 Not to mention the Siri function is extremely useful when working out	1.0
1308	5.0	 I still think they’re a tad bit expensive for what they are	1.0
1309	5.0	I live for these AirPods	1.0

1317	1.0	 So much for that Christmas present for my son	1.0
1318	5.0	Very happy with these headphones	1.0
1319	5.0	 For years I have been buying either knock off blue tooth headphones that either do not fit in my ears (they are small), stay in place during activity (such as running) and or are not compatable with my iphone	0.0
1320	5.0	 It is quite expensive, however worth it for wireless headphones that actually work for all of the above issues I had with previous headphones	1.0
1321	5.0	 The only downside is that occasionally the headphones are slow or delayed to react to a song change (with the double tap) or will fall out easily if I hit them accidentally	0.0
1322	5.0	 Otherwise they do stay in place well, I am just an accident prone person	0.0
1323	5.0	 The case is also nice so I do not loose them	1.0
1324	5.0	 I definitely recommend spending the extra $$ for these if you have an iphone	1.0

1328	5.0	 It's also super nice without any wires anywhere when I need to use them in public	1.0
1329	5.0	 The audio is really great for me, almost too good	1.0
1330	5.0	 The first few days I had it, I would listen to lectures and I could pick up sounds that made me think someone was near me and it would freak me out lol	1.0
1331	5.0	I love these AirPods	1.0
1332	5.0	 I ended up getting a pair of Pros after because they didn’t fit my ears, but I was still very impressed with these	1.0
1333	5.0	Call quality is crystal clear	1.0
1334	5.0	 Range is excellent- I could hear my calls from the basement all the way to the 2nd floor	1.0
1335	5.0	 They snap in the case perfectly, and the case is tiny and fits easily in my pocket	1.0
1336	5.0	 Sound quality is good	1.0
1337	5.0	Bad fit - not good for small ear canals like mine	0.0
1338	5.0	 Ambient sounds can be a bit loud (didn’t expect noise cancellation, though)	0.0
1339	5.0	 Stems are long and awkward looking, and therefore easier to knock out	0.0
1340	3.0	Great except the Left one falls out	0.0
1341	3.0	 Fell out multiple times as I ate dinner	0.0
1342	3.0	 I really wanted to like these	1.0
1343	3.0	 if I’m always afraid one will just fall out then what good are they	0.0
1344	5.0	LOVE THEM	1.0
1345	5.0	Everything about them pair so well with my iPhone	1.0
1346	5.0	 Sound quality is through the roof and the noise cancellation is one thing that will come in handy on the busy roads	1.0
1347	5.0	 The battery life lasts so long too	1.0
1348	5.0	 They came very secure so they weren’t damaged and everything was in place	1.0
1349	5.0	 Love it	1.0
1350	5.0	I bought these for xmas but decided to let him try them to make sure they were okay	1.0
1351	3.0	After using the airpods for a week or so, I am not thrilled and for this price, I expect better	0.0
1352	3.0	 Although the design is beautiful, it is hard to get them in your ears, even harder is keeping them in your ears	0.0
1353	3.0	 I bought them to use on the treadmill and listen to my ipad while cooking	1.0
1354	3.0	 Exercising with them is frustrating, with the sweaty moisture that goes with exercise, the airpods fall out of your ears and I am going back to the traditional ear buds	0.0
1355	5.0	I have been wanting a pair of AirPods for a minute but I just didn’t have the funds to get them, so I saved up some money and FINALLY got them	1.0
1356	5.0	 But of course, I wanted to check if there was a cheaper and easier way to buy them as the closest Apple store is an hour away from me and lo and behold I saw these beauties for $30 cheaper than they are on the Apple store	1.0
1357	5.0	 I waited a dreadfully long 3 days for them to come and oh my god, I was on top of the moon when I saw they were delivered	1.0
1358	5.0	 Now before I ordered them I was very skeptical as some people were saying they were fakes and they broke on them as soon as they opened their Airpods	0.0
1359	5.0	 I don’t know what their reviews were, but mines are brand new	1.0
1360	5.0	 Sealed and brand new package with brand new Airpods	1.0
1361	5.0	 Connecting them was a breeze and the sound quality is much better compared to the regular ear pods Apple has that comes with the phones	1.0
1362	5.0	 I’m in love and I am here to assure you, even though my review will probably get lost in the mix, that these are the real things and I am very satisfied with my purchase	1.0
1363	1.0	Ok, this is my second review after Amazon deleted my first one	1.0
1364	1.0	 In their email they claimed it was authentic and it was not fake	1.0
1365	1.0	 If it was authentic why Apple website didn’t recognize it when I entered the S/N to verify its authenticity	1.0
1366	5.0	The sound quality is good	1.0
1367	5.0	 But the battery life and the charging capability is absolutely amazing	1.0
1368	5.0	 They are just perfect	1.0
1369	5.0	 No wires bothering you, they stay in good	1.0
1370	5.0	 Someone ask you a question you take one out it pauses the music	1.0
1371	5.0	 Take them out put them in the case and in 15 minutes you have fresh head phones	1.0
1372	5.0	 I haven’t charged the case in over a week and I’m still going strong	1.0
1373	5.0	 The way they are engineered is truly amazing	1.0
1374	5.0	Great sound in a tiny comfortable size	1.0
1375	5.0	 To get any better sound quality you would have to go to full size Bose or Beats	1.0
1376	5.0	 I am a musician and truly appreciate the sound quality given the convenience of size and price point	1.0
1377	5.0	 The noise cancellation is not the quality of large headphones but in every other sense, these are great	1.0
1378	5.0	 Also great ease of Bluetooth connection; just put them in your ears and they connect, no buttons needed	1.0
1379	5.0	 Great mic for phone calls and the battery life is amazing	1.0
1380	5.0	 I use them for hours, just plug case in at night and pods stay charged at all times	1.0
1381	3.0	Sound is excellent for listening to music, watching shows online, and talking on the phone	1.0
1382	3.0	 I think the mic is very good, too	1.0
1383	3.0	 But I had these on for an hour and had to remove them twice because they hurt my ears	0.0
1384	3.0	 But they’re almost double the price	0.0
1385	4.0	I bought these because I had trouble keeping similar wireless headphones in my ears while walking or exercising	1.0
1386	4.0	 Other wired or wireless headsets with interchangeable, difference sized soft ear pieces never fit right and had a tendency to come loose or slip out entirely	1.0
1387	4.0	 Very annoying at the gym in the middle of a class or on the treadmill	0.0
1388	4.0	 These are so light and hang on the ear that you don't notice they are there	1.0
1389	4.0	Frankly I don't use them on an iphone device but on an Android phone	1.0
1390	4.0	 That shouldn't matter	1.0
1391	4.0	 The only negative is that every once in a while they seem to go out of sync	1.0
1392	4.0	 This causes an echo effect	0.0
1393	4.0	 It becomes difficult to understand spoken word because of the echo	0.0
1394	4.0	 The only way I have found to fix it is to go to Bluetooth settings, disconnect, then reconnect the AirPoids	0.0
1395	4.0	 That means I have to stop my exercise program to restart them	0.0
1396	4.0	 Very annoying	0.0
1397	4.0	 The connected device used shouldn't matter if the Bluetooth is compatible	1.0
1398	5.0	I initially bought Samsung earbuds because they were highest rated	0.0
1399	5.0	 I found them to be uncomfortable and more expensive, so I returned them and purchased the earbuds	1.0
1400	5.0	 They work well, except sometimes people say they cannot hear me	1.0
1401	5.0	 I like the fit, and the convenience of not having any wires	1.0
1402	5.0	 They’re the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever had	1.0
1403	5.0	These AirPods arrived in perfect condition	1.0
1404	5.0	 New, sealed box with instructions, charging cable, charging case, and of course, the AirPods	1.0
1405	5.0	 I don’t know why the other reviews are a mixed bag of poor to terrible so far as the product is concerned	1.0
1406	5.0	 You can tell from my pictures that there is absolutely nothing wrong with them	1.0
1407	5.0	 I don’t think these are intended for noise canceling, so I rated them a 3 in that area	1.0
1408	5.0	 Otherwise, 5 stars	1.0
1409	5.0	 The AirPods and charging case arrived more than 75% charged, too	1.0
1410	5.0	 Ready to go right out of the box	1.0
1411	5.0	 Love them	1.0
1412	1.0	These airpods are 1st generation	0.0
1413	1.0	 It’s obvious as soon as you open the box	0.0
1414	1.0	 The light that indicates if it’s charging is on the inside of the case rather than on the outside of the case	0.0
1415	1.0	 I’m very disappointed but I’ve already opened it so I don’t think I can return them	0.0
1416	1.0	 If you’re looking for Apple products just go directly to the Apple site	1.0
1417	5.0	AirPods came as expected, nothing unusual	1.0
1418	5.0	 If you’re trying to decide if you need to get the wireless case, I would say just go for the wired case	1.0
1419	5.0	 It charges so fast it isn’t even a problem	1.0
1420	5.0	 When your AirPods die, the case has charge in it as well, so in a way, it is like having wireless charging	1.0
1421	5.0	 As long as the case is charged, you can put your AirPods in without having to plug into the wall and it charges	1.0
1422	5.0	These AirPods don’t fit in my ears like the apple ear pods	0.0
1423	5.0	 They’re a little looser and don’t go as far into my ears, I’ve noticed	0.0
1424	5.0	 I’ve gotten use to it and I just turn the volume up a little	1.0
1425	5.0	The best thing about these headphones isn’t the sound quality	1.0
1426	5.0	 For me it’s just the user experience	1.0
1427	5.0	 It automatically connects to the apple device I’m using and the battery percentage shows	1.0
1428	5.0	 Pop an AirPod out and whatever you’re watching or listening to pauses	1.0
1429	5.0	 Can tap on the AirPod to answer a call	1.0
1430	5.0	 I bought them for convenience	1.0
1431	5.0	Got these as a Christmas gift for my wife	1.0
1432	5.0	 She has recently started using an exercise bike and with the new Apple Health + option, I got these so that she could listen to the workouts while riding in comfort	1.0
1433	5.0	 The noise cancellation on these is really good as well, doesn't block out all noise, but you can melt away while using them	1.0
1434	5.0	 She has used them almost daily since she got them for Christmas and is in love with them	1.0
1435	5.0	Just received my new pair	1.0
1436	5.0	 I had a pair of AirPods but unfortunately left them in my pants pocket and they went through a wash cycle	1.0
1437	5.0	 So I went on amazon to see about buying a new pair	1.0
1438	5.0	 My old pair was free but this pair was $136 with tax	1.0
1439	5.0	 I was definitely hesitant to buy these from amazon because of some of the reviews but I’m here to say these are AWESOME	1.0
1440	5.0	 They are legit Apple AirPods and they’re cheaper on amazon	1.0
1441	5.0	 The one on the left is my old pair and the new ones are on the right	1.0
1442	5.0	 There is no difference	1.0
1443	5.0	 Take it from me, you won’t regret it	1.0
1444	5.0	 Just make sure to check your pockets ALWAYS	1.0
1445	5.0	 They are not water proof and the advice Apple gave me did not work for the old ones (leave it out for 24 hours)	1.0
1446	5.0	 Good investment if you listen to music a lot, make calls, like the convenience of no cords	1.0
1447	5.0	 Just be careful because it’s a lot of money to lose if you have no AppleCare	1.0
1448	5.0	 Even with AppleCare there are still fees to replace them	1.0
1449	5.0	I’d gone through many different types and models of ear buds, and was never happy with any of them	0.0
1450	5.0	 My wife got these for Christmas and they’re astounding	1.0
1451	5.0	 I’ll never go back to the ones with wires attaching the two ear buds	1.0
1452	5.0	 Crystal clear audio	1.0
1453	5.0	 The music is like listening to a high end sound system with each instrument audible at any volume and the battery set up with charging in the case while you’re not near a plug to charge is an added feature that cannot be overstated as being very, very cool	1.0
1454	5.0	 Highly recommend these earbuds	1.0
1455	3.0	if you will only use these with Apple devices, you will probably be completely thrilled	1.0
1456	3.0	 But if you are connecting to, say, a Sony TV, there are challenges	0.0
1457	3.0	 You can't adjust the volume of the earphones	0.0
1458	3.0	"And if you switch between devices, you have to ""connect"" again on the device"	0.0
1459	3.0	 Again, I think if you were all Apple ios, these issues would arise and you would be 100% happy	1.0
1460	5.0	My son loves these because he can charge his phone and listen to music at the same time	1.0
1461	5.0	 His friends gently teased him about having wired headphones	0.0
1462	5.0	 His is happy about the way they fit and the sound is great	1.0
1463	5.0	 This was a good purchase because I was able to save a few dollars	1.0
1464	5.0	 It was a good Christmas gift	1.0
1465	5.0	 You have to keep up with technology and of course that comes at a cost	1.0
1466	5.0	 It was a good purchase	1.0
1467	5.0	I hesitated to buy AirPods for a long time because I thought they were quite pricey but when the good deal came available I decided to finally get them	1.0
1468	5.0	 I’m very glad I did as the sound quality is great and they’re so comfortable to wear	1.0
1469	5.0	 I really like how easily they pair with all my Apple devices	1.0
1470	5.0	 All in all, I’m very happy with my purchase	1.0
1471	5.0	Now, normally I dont use Apple products besides my iPad pro (2018) and Apple pencil 2nd Gen for drawing	1.0
1472	5.0	But I was seeking some sleek, good sounding earbuds that would go well with my iPad	1.0
1473	5.0	 Back when I got my iPad, Airpods were way too much for me	1.0
1474	5.0	 But throughout the years, they have fallen in price	1.0
1475	5.0	 So I decided to buy them here	1.0
1476	5.0	 They were only $115	1.0
1477	5.0	 That, I thought was a steal	1.0
1478	5.0	 I ordered em up, quick	1.0
1479	5.0	 Came just in time	1.0
1480	5.0	 Very quick delivery as well	1.0
1481	5.0	 I love customization, custom ROMs, and such	1.0
1482	5.0	I have also used them with my iPad, and I must say, the tech is so fast to pair	1.0
1483	5.0	 They sound great, and they look great	1.0
1484	5.0	Anyone who has an android phone that were considering getting these	0.0
1485	5.0	It's a set of Apple Air Pods	1.0
1486	5.0	 If you don't think they are the greatest thing ever, then you obviously hate democracy and eat babies	1.0
1487	5.0	 I have no use for Apple's overpriced, locked-down stuff	0.0
1488	5.0	 Wife says these work well, sound great, no issues	1.0
1489	5.0	 So, you know, there you go	1.0
1490	4.0	I don’t think the sound quality of the AirPods provide much competition to actual over ear headphones	0.0
1491	4.0	 However, I do think they make up for it with all the convenience they’ve packed into these little earbuds	1.0
1492	4.0	 The AirPods are quick to connect to the last device you’ve used them with, and they have pretty good range on them	1.0
1493	4.0	 I’m able to walk around the office while listening to Spotify without any interruptions	1.0
1494	4.0	 When I’m not listening to anything, I happily place them back in the charging case the AirPods come with	1.0
1495	4.0	 I also would like to point out how great it is to be able to charge your AirPods on the go since the charger case is small enough to fit in your pocket	1.0
1496	4.0	 I’ve used these buds at the gym, in a busy train, and while walking through the bustling streets of Chicago during rush hour without any complaints for sound or noise cancelling	1.0
1497	4.0	 As I’ve mentioned earlier, they won’t perform better than actual premium over the ear headphones in terms of sound and noise cancellation, but they still perform very well given what’s provided and these small little ear buds	1.0
1498	4.0	 I would certainly buy these again, and would completely recommend them to anyone who is curious	1.0
1499	2.0	the sound SOUNDS okay, but it's so quiet	1.0
1500	2.0	 there's no noise cancelation at all	0.0
1501	2.0	 the battery life started good and has been rapidly decreasing	1.0
1502	2.0	 sometimes they won't link to my phone	0.0
1503	2.0	 sometimes they randomly disconnect	0.0
1504	2.0	 if I turn the volume down for a second when I turn it back up the volume is still quiet until I put them back in the case for a minute	0.0
1505	2.0	 then the volume bar is still all the way down but when I turn it up again it gets louder	0.0
1506	2.0	 same thing if you turn it up accidentally and try to turn it down	0.0
1507	2.0	 I've only had them for 6 months, and I don't even use them that much	1.0
1508	2.0	 I had a better experience with 30$ Bluetooth earbuds from home depot	0.0
1509	2.0	These AirPods have good sound and worked reliably until 2 days ago, less than 2 months after purchased, when they stopped pairing properly, and alternately had sound only from the left, then the right	0.0
1510	2.0	Messaging contact with Apple Tech Support was an exercise in frustration	0.0
1511	2.0	 An agent who must have been handling several other calls took an hour and a half to walk us through a procedure that should have taken five minutes, finally arriving at the obvious conclusion that there was a problem	0.0
1512	2.0	 Then the fun began, eventually preparing to send them back for evaluation, for which I was told at the last minute that they wanted a credit card deposit for more than I paid for them	0.0
1513	2.0	 The support agent claimed that although the 1-year limited warranty applied to battery issues, it did not apply to connectivity issues	0.0
1514	2.0	 Doesn't sound right	0.0
1515	2.0	Surely, Apple could do better than this	0.0
1516	2.0	 At this point I decided to check on Amazon's return policy and discovered that we are still within the time window for return/replacement	1.0
1517	2.0	 So that's what we'll do	1.0
1518	2.0	I've bought lots of Apple products and have been generally satisfied, but maybe I'll be less stuck on the brand in the future	0.0
1519	5.0	Best purchase of Black Friday 2021	1.0
1520	5.0	 You don’t need the latest version of AirPods, these will do just fine	1.0
1521	5.0	 They have a great battery life	1.0
1522	5.0	 The structure could be slightly better because they do tend to fall out sometimes but no big deal	1.0
1523	5.0	 Buy it, you won’t regret it	1.0
1524	5.0	Okay, I am an Apple fan, have been for a while	1.0
1525	5.0	 I love this second-gen over the 3rd gen	1.0
1526	5.0	 they fit and feel better in my opinion	1.0
1527	5.0	 there was only one difference that happened to catch me off guard	0.0
1528	5.0	 There is no indicator light on the front of this set	1.0
1529	5.0	 That is not a problem, but it was a slight difference between my 1st set and this set	1.0
1530	5.0	 They are still my go-to most of the time	1.0
1531	4.0	These are good AirPods	1.0
1532	4.0	 Unfortunately, they hurt my ears	0.0
1533	4.0	 I have bought a total of three of these AirPods	0.0
1534	4.0	 One for my daughter, one for my boyfriend, and one for me	1.0
1535	4.0	 They do not hurt my boyfriend or daughter’s ears, so it may just be me	1.0
1536	4.0	 I do have smaller ears and may be the reason they hurt me	1.0
1537	4.0	The sound is amazing	1.0
1538	4.0	 If you are looking for good soundproof earbuds, these are not for you	0.0
1539	4.0	I had to buy the AirPods Pro for the extra comfort	1.0
1540	4.0	 The AirPods Pro’s have both amazing sound and soundproof	1.0
1541	4.0	These are real AirPods, for those who doubt their legitimacy	1.0
1542	1.0	These AirPods are EXTREMELY flawed	0.0
1543	1.0	 This is the second pair of second generation AirPods I bought where the microphone completely stopped working	0.0
1544	1.0	 I now have two pairs of AirPods that do not have a working microphone and I need them to talk with for my work	1.0
1545	1.0	 Incredibly disappointed with Apple and this crappy AirPods	0.0
1546	1.0	I just bought the third generation and let’s see if those last longer than six months	0.0
1547	1.0	First of all it was okay once I received but it kept falling out from my ear	0.0
1548	1.0	 No worries	1.0
1549	1.0	 The following day I lost one ear piece	0.0
1550	1.0	 Oh well I figured I have one to use and listen to music or something	1.0
1551	1.0	 Couple of days later entirely stopped working and I had to order a new one	1.0
1552	1.0	 Money well spent for a $120 ear phones	1.0
1553	4.0	The AirPods are about what you would expect from Apple - spendy, clever, and extremely functional	1.0
1554	4.0	 Sturdy, comfortable, and convenient wireless abilities allow alot of movement whether working out, skating, or mowing the lawn	1.0
1555	4.0	 They have never fallen out of my ears	1.0
1556	4.0	 While there is no real noise cancellation function and sound quality is pretty good	1.0
1557	4.0	 Where this product really shines, is in the battery charge/recharge ability	1.0
1558	4.0	After a year: These are still awesome	1.0
1559	4.0	 There has not been a noticeable decline in charge	1.0
1560	4.0	 They still last about 2 hours between charges	1.0
1561	4.0	 The case only has to be charged about every two days	1.0
1562	4.0	Having tried the air-pod pros, I think these are still more comfortable	1.0
1563	4.0	Sound quality is still good to excellent	1.0
1564	4.0	Mic quality is pretty good	1.0
1565	4.0	Only real drawback is the case has a tendency to collect lint and stuff in the cracks and edges from being in your pocket	0.0
1566	4.0	Totally still recommend	1.0
1567	5.0	I bought these airpods a few months ago just because they had the best price on the market	1.0
1568	5.0	 They arrived as brand new airpods in an apple box	1.0
1569	5.0	 They are made in California but assembled in Vietnam not China	1.0
1570	5.0	 The only thing that apple could have improved would've been the battery life	0.0
1571	5.0	 These are the second generation of the apple airpods	1.0
1572	4.0	These headphones aren't too bad	1.0
1573	4.0	 To me the quality is somewhat better than the free headphones you get with your iPhone	1.0
1574	4.0	 They don't do much to block out sound but that's OK with me	1.0
1575	4.0	 I have my Jabra wireless headphones for that	1.0
1576	4.0	 The sound quality is good but not as good as others	1.0
1577	4.0	 Connecting to your iPhone is fast	1.0
1578	4.0	 When using them to talk on the phone, the other party says I sound fine and I can hear them well so that's a plus	1.0
1579	4.0	 I find it difficult to have a conversation using headphones that totally block out outside noise	0.0
1580	5.0	The set up was fairly easy so far I am enjoying the wireless feature	1.0
1581	5.0	 I got tired of cords and headphones dying on me way to quickly	0.0
1582	5.0	 They are fairly secure in your ears once on, not too easy to fall off	1.0
1583	5.0	 Its worth it to invest in a better pair of headphones that should last	1.0
1584	5.0	 I did have any issues connecting with the blue tooth connectivity	0.0
1585	5.0	 I'm very happy with my purchase so far	1.0
1586	5.0	 I haven't tested the battery life yet though	1.0
1587	5.0	 So its a 5 for now	1.0
1588	5.0	So many debate the price and sound quality	1.0
1589	5.0	 I'm not going to do that	1.0
1590	5.0	 I know if that is all you care about you can find better	1.0
1591	5.0	 I have a MacBook, Ipad, Apple watch, and Iphone	1.0
1592	5.0	 It switches so easy between them	1.0
1593	5.0	 I use wifi calling a lot and can use any device to do this even when I forget my phone somewhere else	1.0
1594	5.0	 That is why the easy device switching is important to me and it is faster than previous generation	1.0
1595	1.0	When I receive them open the box they came just like this looks like they’ve been used and they were broken so only 1 worked didn’t really get to try them out very disappointed	0.0
1596	2.0	Even though I’m sure to keep my AirPods clean, after a year, so much earwax has been jammed into the AirPods that audio is significantly quieter	1.0
1597	2.0	 Not worth the money	0.0
1598	2.0	 No noise cancellation which is pretty standard at the end of 2021	0.0
1599	2.0	 Battery is great	1.0
1600	2.0	 The AirPods last for a long time but the case starts to deplete faster as you use them	0.0
1601	2.0	 The microphone is horrible	0.0
1602	2.0	 I feel there are better options than these	1.0
1603	2.0	 If you want to spend some extra money, the AirPods Pro’s are a good choice	0.0
1604	2.0	 Silicone tips (which would prevent the earwax issue), great noise cancellation, better microphones, recent	0.0
1605	2.0	 Conclusion is, they’re great for about a year but unless you don’t produce earwax, they start to get quieter	1.0
1606	4.0	I really like over the head, noise canceling headphones, but it gets pretty hot over the summer in LA, so I can't wear them as often as I would like	1.0
1607	4.0	 I decided to try the AirPods after several recommendations from my friends	1.0
1608	4.0	 It doesn't cancel external noise, but they feel weightless and they are incredibly easy to set up	1.0
1609	4.0	 The battery lasts a decent amount of time and the charging case is small enough that you can keep it in your pocket	1.0
1610	4.0	 They fit really well	1.0
1611	4.0	 They don't reproduce low frequencies as well as over the head headphones, but they don't sound bad at all	1.0
1612	4.0	 A great buy for non-audiophiles	1.0
1613	5.0	I love my AirPods so far	1.0
1614	5.0	 I have only had them for a few days but they have been great for listening to music	1.0
1615	5.0	 The sound quality is amazing and I have had no problems with connecting to my iPhone XS	1.0
1616	5.0	 They connect as soon as I put them in my ears, which is very convenient	1.0
1617	5.0	 They connected right away to my iPad with no problem as well	1.0
1618	5.0	 Battery life is excellent	1.0
1619	5.0	 No issues with that after hours of listening to music	1.0
1620	5.0	 So far I love them and am very happy with my purchase	1.0
1621	5.0	Had Gen 1 and used them everyday for 4 years	1.0
1622	5.0	 Same function just as good	1.0
1623	4.0	 I love being able to keep my phone in my bedroom and still being able to go to the bathroom while still hearing my music	1.0
1624	4.0	 The battery life is really long, longer than I thought	1.0
1625	4.0	 The case is small and sleek and the AirPods are also small and look good	1.0
1626	4.0	 They may not work for every ear type, as it fell out of my small ears for a while before I got used to them	0.0
1627	4.0	 Pretty easy to connect to my iPhone and they sound nice	1.0
1628	4.0	 I love the features where it stops when you take one out	1.0
1629	5.0	I love love love these	1.0
1630	5.0	 Was hesitant to purchase because of price	0.0
1631	5.0	 Wasted $30 on cheaper version and they lose connection a lot and have to turn phone off and on to re connect	0.0
1632	5.0	 These have performed flawlessly	1.0
1633	5.0	 Can set tap control to preference	1.0
1634	5.0	 I det my right to play/pause and left to skip	1.0
1635	5.0	 Excellent	1.0
1636	2.0	Upon buying them, you'll have three more things to keep charged all the time	1.0
1637	2.0	Supporting software makes it difficult to know precisely how much charge is in either of the three devices	1.0
1638	2.0	You'll also be constantly worried about losing them	1.0
1639	2.0	 When you do, Apple will make you pay for the replacement	1.0
1640	2.0	It's hard to wear them for a long period of time -- they start to hurt your ears after a while, as they are only made of hard plastic	0.0
1641	5.0	I love the 2nd generation AirPods	1.0
1642	5.0	I also asked the young members of my staff for their opinion of the newer-generation AirPods; who unanimously endorsed the 2nd generation over the 3rd and 3rd (pro) generations	1.0
1643	5.0	sometimes, the newest is not necessarily the best	1.0
1644	5.0	This is like my third purchase of the airpods 2	1.0
1645	5.0	 I end up giving them to my kids and then buying another pair for myself	1.0
1646	5.0	 I’m not sure why, but these things seem to sound a lot better than my air pod pros	1.0
1647	5.0	 The bass is much deeper, producing a sound I appreciate a lot more	1.0
1648	5.0	 Weird, cuz I always hear the critics complaining about the opposite	0.0
1649	5.0	 Lucky me I guess	1.0
1650	4.0	My sister asked me to order these for her	1.0
1651	4.0	 She seems to like them quite a bit as when she’s home she appears to always have them in	1.0
1652	4.0	 The sound quality is good, and the battery life appears to be good as well	1.0
1653	4.0	 Not sure about the noise cancellation feature so cannot comment on that	0.0
1654	4.0	They didn’t arrive the first time it was “supposedly shipped”, so I had to get a replacement which arrived on the expected date	1.0
1655	4.0	Loveeee	1.0
1656	4.0	 I’m starting to question if they are the real Apple AirPods because of the other reviews	0.0
1657	4.0	 They work well, but they are cheaper than the ones on the apple website and I want to know why	1.0
1658	1.0	The left AirPod for these won't connect to the charger	0.0
1659	1.0	 We contacted Apple and they said we had to contact Amazon for them to honor the warranty	0.0
1660	1.0	 I contacted the Warranty Questions team and they will NOT reply	0.0
1661	1.0	 Our year warranty date is approaching and this is incredibly frustrating they won't reply and get this taken care of	0.0
1662	5.0	I was super hesitant to buy AirPods	0.0
1663	5.0	 I thought they were aesthetically I’m appealing they reminded me of Qtips	1.0
1664	5.0	 But I ended up actually really loving these	1.0
1665	5.0	 They charge super fast and they aren’t IN my ear	1.0
1666	5.0	 Once you open the case they were automatically connected to my phone	1.0
1667	5.0	 I didn’t have to do any setup	1.0
1668	5.0	 The cons are they are not noise cancelling and you have to take them out to talk to someone unless you can hear through them	1.0
1669	5.0	 My bf says they fall out a lot	1.0
1670	5.0	 I think everyone’s ear anatomy is just different	1.0
1671	5.0	 Yes, they were noise cancelling and had this cool hear through function but they wouldn’t stay in, especially my left ear	1.0
1672	5.0	If you buy these make sure when you buy it says sold and shipped by Amazon	1.0
1673	5.0	 Do not buy from other sellers because you will get fake AirPods	1.0
1674	5.0	 If you buy from Amazon you will get authentic AirPods for less than you would buy at Apple stores	1.0
1675	5.0	 These have great sound and great battery life	1.0
1676	5.0	 Of course, the more you use them the quicker the battery life would diminish	1.0
1677	5.0	 These are great if you iPhone 7 or greater because there is no earphone/headphone jack and can make it so that you can listen and charge at the same time	1.0
1678	5.0	 A main reason I got this	1.0
1679	3.0	I expected to be jumping for joy when I put these pods in my ears	1.0
1680	3.0	 The sound is fine, not superior to my wired ones	1.0
1681	3.0	 I tried to adjust volume by asking Siri to lower the volume and her reply was it’s already high	0.0
1682	3.0	I’m hoping minor headaches are not a permanent part of the joy of using them	1.0
1683	3.0	I’ll update when things change	1.0
1684	2.0	I thought I grabbed a good deal but it was too good to be true	1.0
1685	2.0	At first when I would take the right AirPod out of the case & it would pop up on my notifications, it would glitch as if was unsure if I took it out or not	1.0
1686	2.0	 an update was giving hoping it would fix the issue but it did not	1.0
1687	2.0	I ended up putting both headphones on and it sounded like a bad stereo	0.0
1688	2.0	 The music wasn’t synced	0.0
1689	2.0	 It was just a hot mess	0.0
1690	4.0	It’s been about three months since I’ve been using my AirPods and aside from memeing with them on the daily, I’ve enjoyed them a great deal	1.0
1691	4.0	 They work really well	1.0
1692	4.0	 the mic transmits my voice well when I call and the sound quality as well as latency is basically the same as using good quality wired earbuds	1.0
1693	4.0	 One thing I’ve noticed is that the case and AirPods are prone to getting weird dirt particles attached to them and stains are a pain to clean	0.0
1694	4.0	 They are white after all soooo makes sense	1.0
1695	4.0	Although the sound quality is really good; around this time I’ve started experiencing weird disconnects and lag	1.0
1696	4.0	 Like the signal is getting disrupted but it only really happens when I’m on break at work	1.0
1697	4.0	 At home or when I’m out and about nothing really happens except for a long delay before they sync with my phone	1.0
1698	4.0	 Battery life seems okay	1.0
1699	4.0	 I think it’s bothersome how I basically have to always leave the case and pods on a charger or they die when they’re not in use	1.0
1700	4.0	 The case I kind of get, but I don’t know why the pods get drained when they’re not connected/playing	0.0
1701	4.0	 Overall I’m satisfied with my purchase	1.0
1702	4.0	 the slight cons don’t really change much for me since I mainly use them when I’m making commutes from home to work or from my room to the bathroom	1.0
1703	4.0	 If you’re an apple person or you wanna buy them just so you can be like “sorry; i didn’t catch that airpods	1.0
1704	3.0	The best thing about these earbuds is how easy they are to use, specifically how they automatically connect to and switch between the devices you’re using	1.0
1705	3.0	 Can seamlessly switch from iPhone to laptop to iPad	1.0
1706	3.0	The shortcomings of these earbuds include	1.0
1707	3.0	 Although the tap controls are customizable, there are some key functions that are missing	0.0
1708	3.0	 Mute/unmute is the most obvious missing function	0.0
1709	3.0	 The sound is good, but far from great	1.0
1710	3.0	 The charging case is very slippery, making it very likely that it will slip out of your pocket	1.0
1711	3.0	 I lost my first pair of these because the case slipped out of my gym shorts pocket when I sat down	0.0
1712	5.0	I considered buying the new Air Pod but when I saw that I could get 2 pairs of these for the price of 1 Pro, I ended up doing just that by buying a pair for my wife and I	1.0
1713	5.0	 While I am sure the noise cancellation feature in the Pros is great, these work perfectly well for our needs, and particularly good and handy for talking on the phone	1.0
1714	5.0	 My wife and I also used them on a plane and while we could definitely hear engine noise	0.0
1715	5.0	we were both happy with the sound/quality and even more happy with the price	1.0
1716	5.0	I have had AirPods since day one, after 4 years the battery went dead	1.0
1717	5.0	 4 years so that speaks for the value and the endurance of the product	1.0
1718	5.0	 On top of that Amazon comes in at the absolute lowest price you can find	1.0
1719	5.0	 Buy them and I promise you will not regret the purchase	1.0
1720	5.0	Amazon is the the place you want to purchase this product	1.0
1721	5.0	you will not find a better price or product guarantee	1.0
1722	5.0	I use it predominantly playing golf, which does stress the limits of the device	0.0
1723	5.0	 If I move too far from the iPhone it’s linked too, it’ll cut in and out, or off entirely	0.0
1724	5.0	 It’s not a fair criticism, but it’s my particular use	1.0
1725	5.0	 It’s also odd, when at a distance, the music will tune in and out depending on the position of my head while putting	1.0
1726	5.0	 Again, most people won’t care	1.0
1727	5.0	 if Apple can improve this, it’ll probably help in other situations	1.0
1728	5.0	 Great sound otherwise and the earbuds are very comfortable over long usage spans	1.0
1729	5.0	It took me a long time to buy into these wireless earphones	1.0
1730	5.0	 I had another pair and quite frankly the pairing to the Bluetooth was terrible sound quality wasn’t great and the battery was awful	0.0
1731	5.0	 I finally broke down and bought these and could not be more impressed	0.0

1764	5.0	 I really like the way the Apple AirPods fit in my ear and they are so light I can hardly tell they are there but they fit snuggly so it would take a lot to dislodge them	1.0

1880	2.0	 Not sure if I got a faulty pair, but it is really frustrating since I spent so much on these	0.0

1885	5.0	Finally got the AirPods after months of denying the need for it	1.0
1886	5.0	 If you are a MacBook user and upgrade to any of the iphones post iPhone 6s, you’ll end end up with headphones that work with your phone but not the MacBook Pro	1.0
1887	5.0	 So annoying, Apple	0.0
1888	5.0	 So eventually you’ll have to get the AirPods to solve the problem	0.0
1889	5.0	Now the actual product review - good design allowing the headphones to charge while in the case	1.0
1890	5.0	 These work best for just about everything except workout and flight travel 	1.0
1891	5.0	 I've wanted wireless headphones since before airpods became a thing	1.0

1901	4.0	 These are just great headphones and they are so much less expensive than the newest latest and greatest model	1.0
1902	4.0	One thing I would recommend is to buy those little ear hook things that help the ear bud stay in your ear	0.0
1903	4.0	 These are especially helpful when using the Airpods for working out/running	1.0
1904	4.0	Otherwise, the case fits conveniently in your pocket, its lightweight, battery life is great, these are perfect	1.0

1912	5.0	the airpods is a no brainer when it comes to wireless earphones if you adopted the apple ecosystem	1.0
1913	5.0	 I really like the feature where it auto connects to your apple device when taken out and also it remembers which apple device you last listen to and connects to that	1.0
1914	5.0	 Also the auto pausing feature it has just puts it way ahead of other competitors	1.0
1915	5.0	 And not to forget the image upgrade it brings to the person wearing it	1.0
1916	5.0	 Definitely a buy	1.0
1917	4.0	I bought these AirPods of Amazon, for my daughter’s birthday, She was so happy and excited	1.0

1920	4.0	 To be able to get both of your AirPods charged equally make sure that your charging case is fully charged	1.0
1921	4.0	 And then overnight place in your AirPods insider charging case that way you have your AirPods and AirPod Case charge for the rest of the day	1.0

1931	3.0	 They are tight fitting with no way of adjusting the fit	1.0
1932	3.0	 Right ear started hurting as the airpod felt like it was pressing against the cartilage of the ear	0.0
1933	3.0	 Strangely they feel so tight that my ears begin to hurt after 30 min of use, but also they feel like they will fall put of the ear because they are super smooth	1.0
1934	3.0	 I should have waited for the air-pod pros	1.0
1935	3.0	 I was going to give these to the girlfriend, but she doesnt even want them	0.0

1943	4.0	I always needed the soft silicone pieces to stick	1.0
1944	4.0	 I don't know if there is a way to get a soft cover over these	1.0
1945	4.0	Just bought a pair of ear hooks that loop over the ear and NOW I can listen to air pods and enjoy	1.0
1946	4.0	the sound while I workout or do lawn work	1.0
1947	4.0	 I wish the ear hooks were around 2 years ago when I first bought them	1.0
1948	4.0	There's not much bad to say	1.0
1949	4.0	 They work great, the pod charger thing is a a great idea	1.0
1950	4.0	Problem is, with careful use, my last pair lasted about 14 months before they just died	0.0
1951	4.0	 That's way to short a life span	0.0
1952	4.0	Still, when it comes to usage, it's better than anything like it	1.0
1953	4.0	 I hate you Apple	0.0
1954	4.0	 Now take my money, damn you	0.0
1955	5.0	Ive never been able to find a good pair of rubber tipped headphones that fit or stay in your ear while active so the wired Apple headphones have always worked best for me	0.0
1956	5.0	 These fit the exact same as the normal wired headphones that used to come with new iPhones	1.0

1961	5.0	 Love the case	1.0
1962	5.0	 Nice and sturdy	1.0

1964	5.0	 No more digging for my phone just to see it’s a spam call	1.0
1965	5.0	Extra bonus…got them on sale	1.0
1966	5.0	These are the real deal Apple AirPods 2	1.0
1967	5.0	 The headphones themselves are the newer version 2 but the case is just the older style and not wireless charging	0.0
1968	5.0	 I really didn’t need the wireless charging so I just went with these	1.0
1969	5.0	 Works great and the battery life is stellar	1.0
1970	5.0	 I use em all day and only have to charge every couples days	1.0
1971	5.0	 Would definitely buy again	1.0

1980	5.0	 I am an avid runner	1.0
1981	5.0	 these stay locked in my ears the entire time	1.0
1982	5.0	I've had a tiny bit of issue where sometimes (rarely) one airpod won't play anything, but putting them back in the case and taking them out again fixes it	1.0
1983	5.0	The only downside is that since I have long hair and these are wireless	1.0
1984	5.0	people will try to talk to me and I won't hear them, giving the impression that I am ignoring people and being rude	0.0
1985	3.0	Really makes me angry that Apple has proprietary stuff, and then it doesn’t work	0.0
1986	3.0	 These lasted about 20 months before beginning to have connective issues intermittently	0.0
1987	3.0	 Now the right one won’t work at all	0.0
1988	3.0	 So now I’m stuck blowing away another $200 bucks to replace them	0.0
1989	3.0	 And not the only one complaining about this	0.0
1990	5.0	In my original review I noted that the airpods are very comfortable and convenient to pair with Iphone and computer	1.0
1991	5.0	 They seem to be optimized for music, where they sound pretty good	1.0
1992	5.0	 However, they were problematic for listening to voices on telephone or zoom	0.0
1993	5.0	 But today I discovered that you can do a custom adjustment on the iphone	1.0
1994	5.0	 With that I now get voice sound on telephone and on zoom (using the iphone for zoom) that is great	1.0
1995	5.0	 The only problem is that I can't find any way to get that adjustment when I am using the Airpods with my macbook pro	0.0
1996	5.0	 Zoom on the mac is very muddy voice	0.0
1997	5.0	Works perfectly	1.0

1999	5.0	 I wish the tapping controls had more functionality	1.0
2000	5.0	 I love the look and feel and quality experience of them	1.0

2002	5.0	 I also keep my wired buds and also a cheap Anker wireless buds that give more control over the functions	1.0
2003	5.0	 They all sound good and all have their uses	1.0
2004	4.0	I got these for a substantial discount	1.0
2005	4.0	 So I wasn't expecting them to be wonderful	1.0
2006	4.0	 The sound quality was excellent	1.0
2007	4.0	 The noise cancellation was very good	1.0
2008	4.0	 The battery life was average	1.0
2009	4.0	 And I have a hard time keeping them in my ears	0.0
2010	4.0	 But they work and for the kinds of calls that I do, they are sufficient	1.0
2011	4.0	 But if you want something for exercising or longer listing periods, probably not your best choice	1.0
2012	1.0	I've tried for two weeks to get used to these airpods	1.0
2013	1.0	 Bought some silicon covers to help hold them in my ear	0.0
2014	1.0	 As the silicon warms up, they fall out anyway	0.0
2015	1.0	 Just slip out without any encouragement	0.0
2016	1.0	 And even though they don't fit snug enough to stay in my ears, they are miserably uncomfortable	0.0
2017	1.0	 I wore them for a walk today and five hours later my ears still ache	0.0
2018	1.0	I liked everything else about these	1.0
2019	1.0	You can’t hear out of them	0.0
2020	1.0	 You need to turn the volume all the way up and then the sound is so muffled and you can’t hear it clearly	0.0

2024	1.0	 Nothing worked	0.0
2025	1.0	 I bought 2 of these for my kids and they won’t even use them	0.0
2026	1.0	 So disappointed	0.0
2027	4.0	I didn't even consider buying AirPods for a while, as there are definitely many more affordable options for bluetooth earphones	0.0
2028	4.0	 However, I never seemed to be fully satisfied with the other options I tried	1.0
2029	4.0	 The sound quality is great, they connect flawlessly and I love that it's easy to switch between devices	1.0
2030	4.0	My only concern is that I have smaller ears and thick, puffy hair	1.0
2031	4.0	 I sometimes find the AirPods will get loose due to the fit or getting caught in my hair	0.0
2032	4.0	 Not a deal breaker for me, but I can't see myself wearing them when I'm too active because I'm fearful I may lose one	0.0
2033	2.0	After the second time I tried them, the left airpod would no longer charge and had to bring them to the apple store	0.0
2034	2.0	 The apple store representative told me the AirPods were defective and that I needed to contact Amazon to get them replaced	0.0
2035	2.0	 Talked to Amazon and they are replacing them	0.0
2036	2.0	 Apple needs to fix this charging issue with the AirPods stems because they don’t last very long or are defective or cheaply made	0.0
2037	5.0	I have been an Apple fanboy since they came out with iPods	1.0
2038	5.0	 These little guys are amazingly light weight, sound quality is amazing	1.0
2039	5.0	 I can have in on for most of the day without worrying about the battery life	1.0
2040	5.0	 I did not get the noise canceling ones, but with these on I can hardly hear other noises around me	1.0
2041	5.0	 Must have item in my opinion	1.0
2042	5.0	My first pair lasted just about a month and the left one failed	0.0
2043	5.0	I called AMAZON and I had a new replacement within 2 days	1.0
2044	5.0	 This second pair works great so far	1.0
2045	5.0	My son has had these for several years and has never had a problem with sound or charging	1.0
2046	5.0	 He steered me towards this product and I am glad	1.0
2047	5.0	So much easier to be using the AirPods for phone calls and not having to hold my phone anymore or use the speaker	1.0
2048	5.0	 Others hear me well when I am conversing with them on the phone while using the AirPods	1.0
2049	5.0	Very good product, excellent Amazon support for first 30 days or so on this item and then continued support is available through Amazon	1.0
2050	3.0	I've had my AirPods for about 2 months and I've had some discomfort with the left one	0.0
2051	3.0	 I figured I'd get used to it and discovered today that I have a small cut inside my ear from an uneven seam on the AirPods	0.0
2052	3.0	On the plus side, the sound quality is great and I like the functions available through the AirPods	1.0
2053	3.0	 If you're new to AirPods, take the time to go through the Tips section on your iPhone	1.0
2054	4.0	 Sound is decent enough for music and podcasts	1.0
2055	4.0	 Battery life could be a bit better but the case and earbuds charge fast	1.0
2056	4.0	 Occasionally I have pairing issues with my iPhone 11 but it’s a quick fix when it happens	0.0
2057	4.0	 Next to no sound isolation so if that’s a priority for you look elsewhere	0.0
2058	1.0	I've bought two pairs of airpods	1.0
2059	1.0	 The first was last year for my boyfriend	1.0
2060	1.0	 They work great and he's never had any problems	1.0
2061	1.0	 I bought a pair for myself	1.0
2062	1.0	it would never connect to my phone or charge and I was easily able to return/exchange	0.0

2066	1.0	 Of course, the return window ended like 3 days ago	0.0
2067	1.0	 I really want my money back so I can just buy directly from Apple, these same fake	0.0
2068	1.0	 Don't waste your money	0.0
2069	5.0	I’ve wanted a pair of air pods since they first came out but never could bring myself to pay that much for headphones	1.0
2070	5.0	 Well I’m glad I finally did because these little guys are amazing	1.0
2071	5.0	 The battery life lasts almost all day for me, the sound is incredible	1.0
2072	5.0	 They don’t cancel out a lot of noise which is what I wanted anyways since I have kids and need to be able to hear them when they call for me	1.0
2073	5.0	 I think these AirPods are worth every penny because I use them everyday and I’m in love with them	1.0
2074	1.0	This is the second pair of air pods ordered	1.0
2075	1.0	 The right side won’t work	0.0
2076	1.0	 These were for my teenage daughter	1.0
2077	1.0	 She spent 2 hours on the phone with 7 different Apple techs to troubleshoot, only to find out that that the serial number on the box doesn’t match the air pods so they couldn’t help her	0.0
2078	1.0	 They said it the fault of Amazon for mixing up the box with the pods	1.0
2079	1.0	 We will be returning these	0.0

2081	5.0	 I read all the negative reviews saying there fake but I don’t agree	1.0
2082	5.0	 the sound quality is good and they sync and work perfectly with my iPhone	1.0
2083	5.0	 These are not the current generation AirPods but Its not a big deal to me	1.0
2084	5.0	 If you want current generation AirPods they will cost you more money but they function exactly the same way, not a big difference	1.0
2085	2.0	I can’t really give a full review on this	0.0
2086	2.0	 I will say that when I first opened them both pods( left and right) worked	1.0
2087	2.0	 However, after trying them on a second time	1.0
2088	2.0	 It seemed that only 1 side would work	0.0
2089	2.0	 I thought maybe just needed a reset	1.0
2090	2.0	 After resetting it every way you could possibly imagine	0.0
2091	2.0	 There was simply no way to have both AirPods work at the same time	0.0
2092	2.0	 Once I put both AirPods in the case	1.0

2097	2.0	 Hopefully this doesn’t have any problems	1.0

2104	2.0	 they're likely going to end up in the trash	0.0
2105	2.0	 I would not recommend buying these for remote work purposes	0.0
2106	2.0	 They also amplify strange noises, like quietly opening packages/envelopes	0.0
2107	2.0	 Sounds like that are amplified through the mic, and are deafening to people on the other side	0.0
2108	2.0	All that being said, for simple music listening, they work	1.0
2109	2.0	 The audio quality is so-so, but they work	1.0
2110	2.0	 It's nice to not have to hassle with cords at the gym	1.0
2111	5.0	I tried the Samsung Galaxy Buds before these	1.0
2112	5.0	they didn’t fit my ears well, they pressed on the cartilage in my ears and the sound was not at good	0.0
2113	5.0	 So I got these and I ave been SUPER happy	1.0
2114	5.0	 They fit just like the ear buds that come with iPhones	1.0
2115	5.0	 I use one at a time while listening to podcasts, books, or talking on them to make the battery last longer	1.0
2116	5.0	I purchased these hoping would hate them and could subsequently return them	0.0
2117	5.0	 Unfortunately, I immediately loved them	1.0
2118	5.0	 I would say the cost is justified for the product	1.0
2119	5.0	 They seem to be a bit more comfortable than the regular apple earbuds, and fit well in my ear even with a daith piercing (regular earbuds did not fit)	1.0
2120	5.0	 Sound and battery quality is great	1.0
2121	5.0	 I love that they fit in tiny skinny jean pockets so that I can always have them with me	1.0
2122	5.0	 As a bonus, I feel like a cool person when walking around with these, as I bought them maybe a year after they became popular	1.0
2123	5.0	My first wireless earbuds	1.0
2124	5.0	 I’ve had Apple’s wired buds forever and decided to try the wireless	1.0
2125	5.0	 Sent them back and got the AirPods 2 and they fit just like the old wired ones	1.0
2126	1.0	 My boyfriend purchased his headphones from Walmart and we did a comparison as far as how long these things hold charge	1.0
2127	1.0	 Today I disconnected my headphones early in the morning	1.0
2128	1.0	 We were both at 100% at 12pm now 8pm and he’s at 80% and I’m at 30% I spent a lot of money on these like everyone else	0.0
2129	2.0	This product was great, but after about 5 months they stopped syncing to my phone	0.0
2130	2.0	 I ran every diagnostic test and tried everything the internet and Apple told me to try	1.0
2131	2.0	 Still nothing	0.0
2132	2.0	It's obnoxious that products like these are beholden to the one month return window	0.0
2133	2.0	 That's okay for something like a shirt or mop	1.0
2134	2.0	 But tech should have a much longer window	1.0
2135	2.0	Just another reason I stopped buying from Amazon	0.0
2136	4.0	These are great and comfortable to wear although they have fell out of my ear several times, which is worrisome	1.0
2137	4.0	 They charge really fast which is a plus and can last a while	1.0
2138	4.0	 I wish they were a little bit louder although that probably wouldn’t be best if you’re worried about your hearing	1.0
2139	4.0	 I like the fact that they are cordless	1.0
2140	4.0	 I wish I could use them while on my laptop	0.0

2410	5.0	 I’ve only ever had a single hiccup with them	0.0
2411	5.0	 I think it was the phone’s fault (couldn’t get them to ship to the next song)	1.0
2412	5.0	 I take phone calls well, they take speech to text dictation well, and the way they read texts back to you is really great	1.0
2413	5.0	 Plus, the fact that you can find even a single lost one is pretty awesome	1.0
2414	2.0	Right airpod stopped working right after the 90 day period to return ended	0.0
2415	2.0	 I was warned not to buy AirPods from Amazon so can’t say I wasn’t	0.0

2417	4.0	I bought these because I always a wanted these 	1.0
2418	4.0	 Price was reasonable so I jumped at them	1.0
2419	4.0	 After receiving them , I didn’t hear much bass which I enjoy	0.0
2420	4.0	 And my cousin told me about the Pro model which had more features and noise cancelling	1.0
2421	4.0	 These are great AirPods for the price and sound great regardless	1.0
2422	5.0	 When we went back to iPhones in July, it didn’t occur to me that AirPods would be the perfect solution because they’re made for switching between apple products	1.0
2423	5.0	 I’m actually looking forward to a week full of meetings, whether on my computer or phone	1.0
2424	5.0	Love, love, love them	1.0
2425	5.0	 I need to be quiet in the mornings while my husband is sleeping	1.0
2426	5.0	 It's so nice to be released from the earbud cord	1.0
2427	5.0	 I also prefer the airbuds to my ear/phone hands free device	1.0
2428	5.0	 These are better sound and more comfortable	1.0
2429	5.0	 I was a bit surprised at the cost but I use them daily so I decided it was reasonable for my situation	1.0
2430	5.0	 In hindsight, I'd recommend them to everyone so matter how often you may use them	1.0
2431	5.0	 I love them	1.0
2432	1.0	Had it for only about 6-7 months, and the case no longer charges, but stay at 0%	0.0

2434	1.0	Apple support has been disappointing too	0.0

2439	5.0	 I make it a few days at work using these 6 hrs a day before I have to charge the case	1.0
2440	5.0	 I use the AirPods to hear virtual meetings and phone calls and listen to live conversations and meetings in person via Live Listen on my iPhone	1.0
2441	5.0	 They do a fantastic job of giving me hearing functionality that I had been lacking	1.0
2442	5.0	 Sound quality, connectivity to Apple devices, battery life is good	1.0
2443	5.0	 these genuine airpods are absolutely still many years ahead of every bit of the competition	1.0
2444	5.0	 Save yourself some time and money and just get these the first time	1.0
2445	3.0	 We got a bad set they would not connect at all to any device apple or not we ended up going to to the apple store and they gave us new ear buds for free	0.0
2446	4.0	 I can't stand the type that push into your ear canal so I was happy to read that these would work with android	1.0
2447	4.0	 You don't get all the features with an android device obviously but that was of little concern to me	1.0
2448	4.0	 I don't need to tell Siri to turn up the volume or battery life to be displayed on my screen	1.0
2449	4.0	 First, they are a bit uncomfortable for someone with smaller ears I guess	0.0
2450	4.0	 The hard plastic rubs on my inner ear with long usage	0.0
2451	4.0	 I am also have trouble with them cutting out a bit and sometimes going out of sync when I am using them to stream	0.0
2452	4.0	 It is worse when I put my phone in my pocket	0.0
2453	5.0	 Of course, the longer I stayed under water, I realized that the audio was cutting out	0.0
2454	5.0	 Both AirPods survived the water	1.0
2455	5.0	 I lived happily ever after	1.0
2456	5.0	Thanks	1.0
2457	1.0	 I charged it, precautiousely, so I dont overcharge; and it started working again for another whole week	1.0
2458	1.0	 Then, on the 4th week of buying this crappy thing, both headphones stopped working	0.0
2459	1.0	 I know it's not because of overcharging because I definitely took precautions	0.0
2460	1.0	 It was definitely a faulty product being sold to me	0.0
2461	1.0	 But that wasn't the good part of this ordeal	0.0
2462	1.0	 So hurray	0.0
2463	1.0	 I am stuck with a pair of dead broke $144 Apple Airpods purchased on Amazon	0.0
2464	1.0	 O, Happy me	0.0
2465	5.0	 I still don't like anything in my ears, but these are really terrific	1.0
2466	5.0	 Music sounds crystalline; bass is good, not gut shaking like my stereo system, but still fine; trebble is good as well	1.0
2467	5.0	Now I've put apps for my favorite classical staions on my phone so I can listen to them sitting on my lanai	1.0
2468	5.0	 I can also listen to my old iPod which has so much of my favorites on it	1.0
2469	5.0	ƒ? I normally have trouble fitting silicone seal earbuds in my ears, so the fact that these just sit in the outer ear is actually a plus for me	1.0
2470	5.0	 Connecting them to my Apple devices (watch, iPhone, iPad) was very easy, and almost instant	1.0
2471	5.0	For an audio device that doesnƒ??t cancel sound, the sound quality is amazing	1.0
2472	5.0	 They are probably a little better than the stock iPhone wired earbuds, for reference	1.0
2473	5.0	 Nothing crazy, but Iƒ??m pleased with them	1.0
2474	5.0	 Since they donƒ??t cancel sound, I can also wear them around the house or out on walks with my dog without the fear that someone will try to get my attention and I wonƒ??t hear them	1.0
2475	1.0	 And when Iƒ??m on telephone calls, in the event I would like to listen to media or music or watch YouTube while Iƒ??m on a phone call, they will work perfectly the music media or YouTube will turn down and I can hear the person perfectly	1.0
2476	1.0	 The second person hangs up the AirPods then go back to not working at all thatƒ??s right I said it folks other than the connect disconnect the sound they do not work at all	0.0
2477	1.0	 Itƒ??s extremely frustrating I have actually had the opportunity to get a second pair sent to me from Amazon and they work just the same	0.0
2478	1.0	 I canƒ??t find anything online about what to do my iPhone is brand new so I donƒ??t know why my phones doing this but no one can give me a good answer and frankly I donƒ??t want to anymore because I just wasted a bunch of money on and they donƒ??t work for anything	0.0
2479	1.0	I am so angry itƒ??s not even funny	0.0
2480	1.0	 I am furious	0.0
2481	1.0	 And highly disappointed in amazon	0.0
2482	1.0	 Wish I could give negative stars	0.0
2483	2.0	These were fantastic and a game changer for me for the first few months	1.0
2484	2.0	 But the left pod stopped working recently	0.0
2485	2.0	 First it took a while for the left to connect	0.0
2486	2.0	 Then it just stopped working no matter what	0.0
2487	2.0	 Shows up as green, 100% battery but still no sound ever comes out of it	0.0
2488	2.0	 Otherwise, I'd recommend AirPods to anyone with Apple devices as they are smart, sleek and convenient	1.0
2489	5.0	 But these AirPods really beat my expectations	1.0
2490	5.0	 They are light, easily chargeable and have solid sound quality	1.0
2491	5.0	 I mainly use it for business calls from iPhone, and this is just magic	1.0
2492	5.0	 Crystal clear quality, like snowflakes in my ears	1.0
2493	5.0	 I wish I got them earlier	1.0
2494	5.0	 The only drawback is a bit weird way to check case charge level	0.0
2495	5.0	 I find this strange, I wish there was easier and more streamlined way to check it	0.0
2496	5.0	 At any rate, this is a great product and I do recommend it to Apple fans	1.0
2497	4.0	 Totally worth it	1.0
2498	4.0	 They fit really well in my ears and have MUCH better sound quality than any other Bluetooth earphones Iƒ??ve used	1.0
2499	4.0	 My teen says hers used to last several hours but now only last an hour and the one she used more often now has diminished sound quality	0.0
2500	4.0	 Iƒ??ve also noticed the diminished quality in the left pod that I use more often	0.0
2501	4.0	 Even diminished, the sound quality is better than other pairs Iƒ??ve had	1.0
2502	4.0	 Not as good as the wired apple earphones but I prefer the Bluetooth ones for most of my daily activities as I still manage to get myself caught in the wires and inadvertently fling expensive things to the ground more often than Iƒ??d like	1.0
2503	5.0	Iƒ??m not exactly sure how long Iƒ??ve had these AirPods but itƒ??s been a long time	1.0
2504	5.0	 If you take care of them they wonƒ??t let you down	1.0
2505	5.0	 The only problem Iƒ??ve had it sometimes it doesnƒ??t detect that itƒ??s in my ears and I have to take them out and cover the sensors with my fingers to force it	0.0
2506	5.0	 I havenƒ??t lost any audio in either pod so itƒ??s still going strong	1.0
2507	5.0	 The audio is clear and relatively good bass	1.0
2508	5.0	 For some people they can fall out easily but Iƒ??ve gone running and trail biking and it hasnƒ??t fallen out once	1.0
2509	4.0	At first I was skeptical in buying this off Amazon and thought Iƒ??d be getting a knock off but I can say Iƒ??m definitely impressed	1.0
2510	4.0	 I decided to buy 2 pairs of these, one for myself and one for my husband for a Fatherƒ??s Day gift	1.0
2511	4.0	 This has definitely been a game changer for me	1.0
2512	4.0	 I love that I am able to connect it to my phone, laptop, and car with Bluetooth	1.0
2513	4.0	 Itƒ??s great that when I want to figure out what my battery percentage is for both the charging case and AirPods, itƒ??ll tell me on my phone just by opening the charging case and the percentage for both will appear on the bottom of my phone screen	1.0
2514	4.0	 I love that thereƒ??s a feature where if I do have my headphones on, Siri will read my messages to me and you can send a reply as well	1.0
2515	4.0	 Siri feature is definitely great for when I am in the middle of something	1.0
2516	4.0	 Battery life, these havenƒ??t lasted me for an entire day	0.0
2517	4.0	 I also love that when the AirPods are about to die, thereƒ??s a DUN-DUN noise that plays to let you know put me on the chargerrrrr	1.0
2518	4.0	 Other than that, Iƒ??m satisfied with my purchase and my husband will love the surprise when he receives it	1.0
2519	3.0	 They're easy to use, sound decent for music, and they work well for phone calls	1.0
2520	3.0	 I should have guessed these wouldn't fit me properly	0.0
2521	3.0	Apple really should offer these in more than one size	1.0
2522	3.0	On battery life, I was on the phone listening to music and/or the news at a reasonable volume for about an hour, then I was on the phone for about two more hours	1.0
2523	3.0	 Indicated battery charge went down from 100% to only 25%	0.0
2524	3.0	" Granted, it's a brand new device, so the batteries might not be quite ""broken in"" yet, but I don't find that impressive"	0.0
2525	3.0	I'd give these a more of a chance and a longer review, but since they simply don't fit right, they don't work for me	0.0
2526	5.0	Lets face it these AirPods are by Apple so you know that they are excellent quality	1.0
2527	5.0	 I absolutely LOVE them and after having them for just one day wonder how I managed without them	1.0
2528	5.0	 For volume control either have Siri adjust the volume or do it manually	1.0
2529	5.0	PRO I love the fact that if an AirPod happens to fall from your ear the media that you were streaming will be paused until the AirPod is reinserted, very cool	1.0
2530	5.0	 I also love that once inserted in ears an on screen charge status shows up, also very cool	1.0
2531	5.0	 I bough a clear silicone case for the AirPods Charging case as 1- Its very small and slick so could easily fall from hands 2- Better protection in event of contact with water (rain)	1.0
2532	5.0	 For less than 150 USD you have these marvellous EarPods which is a fantastic buy IMO	1.0
2533	5.0	 No biggie as to check charge status simply take out & reinsert in one ear & onscreen status appears	1.0
2534	5.0	 Another con is that there is absolutely no noise cancelling ability whatsoever	1.0
2535	5.0	 I am quite happy with these EarPods and if you don't need the noise cancelling feature, I'm certain you will be too	1.0
2536	1.0	 Unfortunately we did not return them in time to receive a refund	0.0
2537	1.0	 The quality is unacceptable and noting like we would expect from aN Apple product that was purchased from Amazon	0.0
2538	1.0	 The AirPods purchased at Costco were of superior quality and exceeded our expectations	0.0
2539	1.0	 The AirPods purchased from Amazon I suspect are likely counterfeit	0.0
2540	5.0	 Great high fidelity sound quality and they are so comfortable, I forget about them	1.0
2541	5.0	 I walk most days while listening to NPR news radio or Amazon music	1.0
2542	5.0	 I also watch news and movies on my PC in my room on Apple wired earphones - but I think I'll switch to using the AirPods from now on	1.0
2543	5.0	 These are perfect for my needs	1.0
2544	5.0	 And they were offered at a reduced price on Amazon	1.0
2545	5.0	 Thank you, APPLE	1.0
2546	5.0	 Thank you, Amazon	1.0
2547	2.0	Despite my earlier review of these AirPods ; they turned out to be a piece of junk	0.0
2548	2.0	 I kept having troubles and sent them back into the Apple Repair center	0.0
2549	2.0	 They worked for about 2 weeks, now I'm having the same issues as before in that one pod displays a low charge and the other at 100%, they drop off completely and I have to start the sound over again on my I-Pod	0.0
2550	2.0	 I'm really angry and feel like I've been sold a defective product	0.0
2551	2.0	 So I will have to deal with the repair center again and go thru that merry go round 	0.0
2552	2.0	 What a real disappointment these things are	0.0
2553	2.0	 I'm glad I bought a 2 year warranty, but this is really frustrating	0.0
2554	2.0	These airpods are not any good	0.0
2555	2.0	 First, they DO NOT hold a charge that long	0.0
2556	2.0	 The sound quality is terrible, If you have one in and the 2nd one near by, it's constantly switching automatically	0.0
2557	2.0	 Unable to hear out of both airpods at the same time either talking or listening to music	0.0
2558	2.0	 While on a call, you have to damn near scream so that the other person can hear you	0.0
2559	2.0	 I'm not pleased at all with these airpods	0.0
2560	2.0	 Lastly, one of the airpods just stopped working	0.0
2561	2.0	 So, this was a bust purchase	0.0
2562	4.0	After buying more than a few less expensive earbuds, both wired and wireless, I finally found a pair that satisfies my intense need for great audio	1.0
2563	4.0	 These fit that need	1.0
2564	4.0	My only issue with these: You donƒ??t want to run or maybe even walk much with these, depending on ear size	1.0
2565	4.0	 At 6ƒ??1ƒ??, I have bigger ears, I guess, and a quick tilt of my head can make at least one fall out	0.0
2566	4.0	Bottom line: Great, clear sound	1.0
2567	4.0	 Frequency range seems evenly balanced - bass, mid-range and high-end all good	1.0
2568	4.0	Battery life seems good	1.0
2569	4.0	Worth the price	1.0
2570	2.0	While initially enamored of my purchase of the Air Pods, I soon discovered that keeping them or one in my ear was uncomfortable	0.0
2571	2.0	 I can go for the length of a conversation, but more than that and my ear begins to hurt	0.0
2572	2.0	 Beyond that, the right AirPod has begun to malfunction, cutting out innumerable times during a conversation despite being fully charged	0.0
2573	2.0	 I have to manually change the mode back to AirPod each time	0.0
2574	2.0	 I also am not so taken with the inability to answer an incoming call with the AirPod	0.0
2575	2.0	" You can ""tap"" it off, I guess, after finishing the call, but one must hunt down one's phone and manually accept the call for the AirPods to work"	0.0
2576	2.0	 Too good, I guess	1.0
2577	2.0	 I tried another kind; it lasted for about a day	0.0
2578	2.0	" Why do these things always claim to be ""improvements'"" but just prove to be less than the initial"	0.0
2579	5.0	 Enter COVID, these are a lifesaver	1.0
2580	1.0	Case wouldn't charge	0.0
2581	1.0	 The airpods easily connected to my phone just as expected	1.0
2582	1.0	 HOWEVER, the case wouldn't charge	0.0
2583	1.0	 I plugged it in and waited for an hour and it never went past 30%	0.0
2584	1.0	 Disappointing tho	0.0
2585	4.0	These (2nd Generation) AirPods are amazing	1.0
2586	4.0	 They offer hours of fantastic sound and are a great way to listen to music and jump on a call anytime	1.0
2587	4.0	 The battery life is pretty solid, giving five hours of listen and talk time	1.0
2588	4.0	 When you place them into the case, they will automatically charge very fast allowing up to 24 hours of listening time without having to plug them in	1.0
2589	4.0	 The only downside is the terrible noise cancellation	0.0
2590	4.0	 It does not offer it as a feature in the product however the lack of noise cancellation is very noticeable	0.0
2591	4.0	 I have also had some issues connecting back to my phone each time but it is very easy to reconnect, so it's not much of a problem	0.0
2592	4.0	 Overall, I would say this is a great product and would highly recommend it	1.0
2593	5.0	 Best decision I have ever made when it comes to my mobile audio	1.0
2594	5.0	 Airpods deliver great sound quality and fit surprisingly well in many different ear types	1.0
2595	5.0	 If you have an iPhone, these are the only earbuds you should even be considering getting with built-in optimization in iOS	1.0
2596	5.0	 Its just too easy to pop out of the case and throw on an audiobook as I run some errands	1.0
2597	5.0	 Battery life is pretty poor though	0.0
2598	5.0	 I was on a discord chat and they lasted for just over 2 hours from a full charge	0.0
2599	5.0	 Yet, it more than makes up for that in its convenience	1.0
2600	5.0	 Thus, I was wired until Bluetooth came out, and mostly disappointed until AirPods showed up	1.0
2601	5.0	 I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality for calls, music, podcasts and books, is actually quite good	1.0
2602	5.0	 As good as my noise canceling Sonys that cost twice as much	1.0
2603	5.0	 As good as they need to be to keep me happy	1.0
2604	5.0	 My husband bought me the same pair that I bought my dad and we love them	1.0
2605	5.0	 I did buy them when they were more expensive so that sucks but I love how if one falls out your music stops playing, you can listen to music, take phone calls, listen to notifications and so forth	1.0
2606	5.0	 The charging case works great	1.0
2607	5.0	 You donƒ??t have to charge it all the time which I like as well	1.0
2608	5.0	 I highly recommend this product	1.0
2609	5.0	 Excellent price now and I would buy them again for others	1.0
2610	1.0	Apple is considering the warrenty from the date you ordered and by the time Amazon process it and ships the order its few days (you will be losing a week of so on your warrenty ) 	0.0
2611	1.0	 Exactly around 1yr time frame our Airpods started giving trouble with low volume after giving run around by both Apple and Amazon, we provided all the proof of receipt etc 	0.0
2612	1.0	 They told us that they cannot honor the warrenty to get it repaired as they consider the Order date as Warrenty, I wish I would have gove to a physical store to buy 	0.0
2613	1.0	 Even if Amazon shipped it to you late you will be cheated out of few days so they can get out of providing help 	0.0
2614	1.0	 Think twice about ordering	0.0
2615	2.0	 I never expected from Apple that they would not charge, or stop charging	0.0
2616	2.0	First just the left one stopped charging then a month later both stopped	0.0
2617	2.0	If we are stuck using these they should have been guarantied for two years	0.0
2618	2.0	 They are useless now	0.0
2619	2.0	Apple needs to do better	0.0
2620	5.0	 Luckily those concerns were misguided as I can say they were definitely worth it (for me personally at least) I no longer have to worry about getting tangled in a cord when trying to do things while listening to music/talking on the phone/etc	1.0
2621	5.0	 and since theyƒ??re Bluetooth and have a pretty decent range I can leave my phone in one room of the house while I walk around listening to music from the pods	1.0
2622	5.0	 They also connect with my Apple Watch and allow me to stream music from there on runs where Iƒ??d rather not take my phone	1.0
2623	5.0	 Iƒ??ve gotten so much use out of them I think they were worth it for sure	1.0
2624	5.0	I was really hesitant on paying this much for ear buds but after considering I've spent more than this on cheap ones that aren't good I went through with it and I'm quite pleased	1.0
2625	5.0	 They are tapered so no need for those unbelievably uncomfortable rubber pieces other ear buds have	1.0
2626	5.0	 They are incredibly comfortable	1.0
2627	5.0	 I can wear them all day and never miss a beat, versus the thirty minutes tops those ones with rubber pieces that hurt my ears	1.0
2628	5.0	 They connect almost instantly, no need to try to pair them or anything like that	1.0
2629	5.0	 They sound fantastic and have a surprising amount of bass	1.0
2630	5.0	 I work construction and I can hear them over the noise at work	1.0
2631	5.0	 They last a good four hours and fully charge in 15 minutes	1.0
2632	2.0	Had to returned after a week because it stopped working	0.0
2633	2.0	 Purchased another pair in person from an electronic store and I can see the difference and makes me feel this were not the real ones or they were refurbished	0.0
2634	5.0	I have to say that I just got these AirPods and I LOVE them	1.0
2635	5.0	PROS: The sound quality is fantastic	1.0
2636	5.0	 Though I have never owned the first generation of the AirPods	0.0
2637	5.0	 I like how easy it is to pair these with my iPhone	1.0
2638	5.0	 It was so quick and simple	1.0
2639	5.0	 No such thing with the AirPods	1.0
2640	5.0	 I love the small container that stores and charges them	1.0
2641	5.0	 It just looks and feel nice in your hand too	1.0
2642	5.0	 I wish that they were a little more snug in my ear	0.0
2643	5.0	 Also with the AirPods it doesnƒ??t give me a battery level status at the top of my phone screen	0.0
2644	5.0	 With the AirPods I have to get the case and open it to get a status of the battery level	0.0
2645	5.0	I love these AirPods and am extremely happy with them	1.0
2646	5.0	 I highly recommend these earbuds	1.0
2647	5.0	 They're great	1.0
2648	5.0	 They sound pretty good and they just work	1.0
2649	5.0	 I love that I can make phone calls with them and have Siri at my beck and call whenever I need something	1.0
2650	5.0	 Also I love that I can use just one at a time, and it can be either the right or left one	1.0
2651	5.0	 These are well thought out, as most apple stuff tends to be	1.0
2652	5.0	 Only thing I don't love is the battery life, but I guess what do you expect for things so small	0.0
2653	5.0	 Nothing I've used works better than Apple Airpods	1.0
2654	5.0	 Its truly amazing	1.0
2655	5.0	 If you're tired of having the person on the other end of a phone call tell you they can't hear you very well because there's too much noise then these are the headphones for you	1.0
2656	4.0	Ok there not Hi-fi, but there pretty darn good	1.0
2657	4.0	 However, after using them after several flights, I hated the white noise they produced, as well as, the fit just did not work for me	0.0
2658	4.0	 That being said the AirPods 2 are great for my ears (no white noise) yes they donƒ??t have active noise canceling but I think the sound great for the price	1.0
2659	4.0	 They also fit my ears perfectly	1.0
2660	4.0	 Reason for four stars is that as an Apple product who owns beats I expected better highs and mid-tones	0.0
2661	4.0	 They do have pretty good base for the size of the ear pod and the sound is not blown out	1.0
2662	4.0	 But they were friendly and did Got it done	1.0
2663	2.0	The Airpods arrived very fast, clean packaging, ez to pair	1.0

2666	2.0	If u r lookn to hear without straining, these ARE NOT the product for u	0.0
2667	2.0	 No onboard volume adjustments, so phone is dialed up to the max	0.0
2668	2.0	 TERRIBLE Audibles	0.0
2669	2.0	Also, the one size fits all earlobs does not work	0.0
2670	2.0	 Battery seems to be good so far	1.0
2671	5.0	 Without going into the settings menu your AirPods are automatically synced just by holding them next to your iPhone	1.0
2672	5.0	 They stop playing music the second you remove them from your ears, you can customize minor commands with the double tap feature	1.0
2673	5.0	 In earphone usually drop out of my ears constantly but these stay in	1.0
2674	5.0	 I do have to admit that I wish these AirPods had a little more bass and were 10% louder, but with all the other features and conveniences added together these AirPods are still worth 5 stars	1.0
2675	3.0	 Sound quality and loudness clearly goes to Galaxy Buds, the airpods just don't do the job	0.0
2676	3.0	 As for stability (staying in ear) again the Buds have the rubber nipples so they stay put and are comfortable unlike the airpods which after a hour or so leave you with a sharp pain where the edge rest against the inside of your ear	0.0
2677	1.0	This is one of the purchases where everything that could go wrong did go wrong	0.0
2678	1.0	 I received the Airpods, and like so many others who have purchased them and left reviews, the left Airpod was defective	0.0
2679	1.0	 So, because of what was an issue on Amazon's end initially, I'm now screwed out $29 for the AppleCare purchase when I was sent defective Airpods	0.0
2680	1.0	If you are willing to buy these Airpods after so many reviewers, including myself, provide feedback stating this product is defective, don't waste your money on the AppleCare	0.0

2682	5.0	 They've only fell out of my ears a few times	1.0
2683	5.0	 The nice thing is that I can switch positions in bed without worrying about the cord	1.0

2689	5.0	 I have been using them for work not that I WFH as a teacher and then enjoy them in the afternoons as well	1.0
2690	5.0	 Definitely invest in a case right away, I've heard complaints of the case opening up too easily without one plus there are a bunch of fun cases you can get	1.0
2691	5.0	 When the charging case is charged these guys charge up in 20 minutes no problem from completely dead	1.0
2692	5.0	 If you don't have apple products I wouldn't spend the money, but the seamless ability to go between all of your apple stuff is 200% worth it if you are already invested and the sound quality is great	1.0
2693	3.0	Battery life (4 hours) is just long enough for a domestic flight but too short for international flights	0.0

2699	5.0	 They are lightweight, super convenient and functional, and I can't seem to live without them	1.0
2700	5.0	 I recommend looking into Apple Care for any and all Apple products that you are considering to buy	1.0
2701	5.0	I never thought wireless AirPods one day could be an object I canƒ??t live without	1.0

2714	3.0	they stay in your ear pretty well	1.0
2715	3.0	they are small and light	1.0
2716	3.0	they sound pretty good	1.0
2717	3.0	Probably the worst battery life of any earbuds on earth	0.0
2718	3.0	I nearly always listen with ONLY 1 earbud in at a time because the other one needs to charge, and I'd rather listen CONTINOUSLY through the day, then have to take both earbuds out and let them charge together	0.0
2719	3.0	Maybe I need a SECOND pair of these so one pair can charge while I'm wearing the other	0.0
2720	4.0	To these work well and I like that you can hang up/answer a call by double tapping	1.0
2721	4.0	 I went ahead and took the leap for the new pro pair & OMG AMAZING	1.0
2722	4.0	 It literally cuts out sound by at least 80-90% in noise cancellation mode, and with easy tap,	1.0
2723	4.0	JUST GET THE NEW AIRPOD PRO	1.0
2724	4.0	 They are comfortable, yes expensive	1.0
2725	4.0	 almost ridiculous but since using I don't regret buying at all	1.0
2726	1.0	 So I other words, the new AirPods that would have been in warranty if I bought them from Apple, are out of warranty because Amazon bought them 6 months before I did	0.0
2727	5.0	Good sound, they fit in the ears and do NOT fall out like corded buds	1.0
2728	5.0	 The sound is good, but don't expect audiophile level sound	1.0
2729	5.0	 You can't expect any better than this from tiny little ear buds	1.0
2730	5.0	 But the essential element to these are the freedom to walk away from your source with NO wires, nothing	1.0
2731	5.0	 The freedom is the charm here	1.0
2732	5.0	 That and the apple name make this worth the investment	1.0
2733	5.0	 But for videos, non serious music listening and whatever else, these are great	1.0
2734	5.0	 I would say it's better to spend the extra money and get the good stuff, than spend twenty or thirty bucks on some unknown product	1.0
2735	5.0	It paired effortlessly with my iPhone seven and my older iPad four	1.0
2736	2.0	 I am now purchasing directly from Apple, these are NOT the latest model, don't be fooled	0.0
2737	5.0	Overall the airpods are ok, but they're very expensive when you could easily spend the money elsewhere and get somewhat similar quality bluetooth headphones	0.0
2738	5.0	 Not always does the battery life display on your phone or device sometimes i have to open and close the case a few times for the phone and or ipad to be able to see my device	0.0
2739	5.0	 It doesnt always connect either, thats another thing I dont like about these things	0.0
2740	5.0	 Also they can fall out easily from your ears and thats really ridiculous when you're already paying a premium price for the things	0.0
2741	5.0	 They only costed me like $30 bucks and here im spending much more and they dont even stay in my ears at all	0.0
2742	2.0	These ear pods are wonderful in quality of sound, ease of use	1.0
2743	2.0	 I particularly like how you just lift it into your ear and it knows to switch	1.0
2744	2.0	Downside: Battery life is surprisingly and disappointingly brief	0.0
2745	2.0	 The buds went dead before the call was finished	0.0
2746	2.0	Ears are not one size fits all	0.0
2747	2.0	 I must be careful when using them or they will fall out of my ear	0.0

2750	2.0	I will not recommend these or purchase again	0.0
2751	5.0	I wouldnƒ??t call myself an Apple fanboy but their devices simply work, and do the one thing they are designated to do better than any other of its competitors	1.0
2752	5.0	 One negative thing about is the fact of noise cancellation being almost none existent	0.0
2753	5.0	 Especially in the subway when the trains are passing by the only sound you hear is the sound of the train and nothing else despite having the AirPods on	0.0
2754	5.0	 Apart from noise cancellation AirPods blow away any other earpieces Iƒ??ve owned	1.0
2755	5.0	 With them having discount of 20 bucks I decided to get a pair and they are exactly what I hoped for	1.0

2761	5.0	 Nothing went wrong and the hubby is happy	1.0
2762	4.0	I have to say that I absolutely love the airpods	1.0

2769	4.0	 They rarely actually fall from my ears	0.0
2770	4.0	 However, they generally slide out of place very easily and I have to keep pushing them back in	0.0
2771	1.0	I have been an early adopter of Apple products and have never been disappointedƒ?? until the AirPods	0.0
2772	1.0	 I then had trouble getting the other AirPod to connect	0.0
2773	1.0	 Still didnƒ??t work	0.0

2809	4.0	 That was annoying AND maybe itƒ??s the new model or something but the top that you flip open is so loose like really really wobbly and feels fake or cheap idk why Apple would change that or if it has something to do with the loose top I explained either way real product but not what I was expecting hopefully they work as long as my first pair I got from the Apple store	0.0

2850	5.0	This is misleading and inaccurate	0.0
2851	5.0	Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement	1.0
2852	5.0	The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing	1.0
2853	5.0	It’s been tested and proven to be faster	1.0
2854	5.0	If you already have the 1st gen, then it’s probably not worth the upgrade	0.0
2855	5.0	If you are looking to buy your first pair of AirPods, then go for these	1.0

2859	5.0	Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency	1.0
2860	5.0	Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time	1.0
2861	5.0	Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time	1.0
2862	5.0	I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy	1.0
2863	5.0	These are great but not much better then gen1	1.0

2950	3.0	I was spectacle at first buying these online and not at an Apple store, but they are the newest model of airpods	1.0
2951	3.0	Unfortunately, the charging case that came with it, is actually the case that comes with the original airpods	0.0
2952	3.0	The new case has the LED on the outside, not on the inside and the Bluetooth pairing button on the back, is supposed to be in the middle of the case, not any lower	0.0
2953	3.0	These are the new airpods, however, it came with the old case for the original airpods	0.0
2954	3.0	Although the 2nd generation AirPods came out in March 2019, improvements are merely incremental	0.0

2974	5.0	I'm no audiophile so to me they sound great	1.0

3060	5.0	The AirPods are the real deal	1.0
3061	5.0	I saw some reviews about knockoffs being sent, not sure what that was about but my order was correct	1.0

3083	5.0	And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device	1.0
3084	5.0	You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy	1.0
3085	5.0	Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback	1.0

3087	5.0	And it's easy to carry everywhere, it being so small	1.0
3088	5.0	Now the sound quality is crisp and connection is smooth, I found that the 2nd gen AirPods are actually better and improved on 1st gen, but its not worth to upgrade, but if you are planning to get your first one, I would definitely say go for the 2nd gen AirPods, I got a pretty sweet deal on amazon and am very happy with my purchase	1.0

3110	1.0	They keep falling out too	0.0

3113	1.0	They are expensive	0.0
3114	1.0	If I had known, I never would have spent this much money	0.0

3144	4.0	Short battery life	0.0
3145	4.0	neither of the charging case or the earphone itself	0.0
3146	4.0	They claims 4hours battery life but in real situation, you get up to 3hours which is far from enough	0.0
3147	4.0	For music enthuast, you should consider to have at least 2 pairs of them, then you can switch when you have to charge	0.0
