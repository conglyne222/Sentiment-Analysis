0,5.0,Everyone is posting that there isn’t a difference between these and the 1st gen
1,5.0, This is misleading and inaccurate
2,5.0," Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement"
3,5.0," The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing"
4,5.0, This isn’t anecdotal
5,5.0, It’s been tested and proven to be faster
6,5.0,"Also, if you opt for wireless charging, buy the case with the gen 2 AirPods and you’ll save a few dollars"
7,5.0,"If you already have the 1st gen, then it’s probably not worth the upgrade"
8,5.0," If you are looking to buy your first pair of AirPods, then go for these"
9,5.0,These AirPods are amazing they automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out
10,5.0, A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward
11,5.0," To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant"
12,5.0," Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency"
13,5.0,"Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time"
14,5.0, Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time
15,5.0,I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy
16,5.0,These are great but not much better then gen1
17,5.0, Only addition is Siri feature
18,5.0, I will rather buy the previous model on discount and Save some green
19,1.0,I had the AirPods for only a few days
20,1.0," every time I opened the charging case (after couple hours - enough time for charging), the left earplug was always at very low battery (0-5%), but the right one is fully charged"
21,1.0, So I returned it
22,5.0,My son really wanted airpods but his parents thought that they were a waste of money so I bought them for him behind their back and he loves them
23,5.0, He has wanted them for a while now and these are really good quality
24,5.0, Real things
25,5.0, He wore them all day long
26,5.0, Glad he's thankful
27,5.0," God Bless, Margaret (Michael's mother)"
28,5.0,"Excellent, pretty useful"
29,5.0, easy to use and reliable
30,5.0," At first I had some doubts about it being reliable to my Mac as some Bluetooth speakers sometimes cut off, but these work great and are really comfortable to my ears"
31,5.0," Aesthetically, they look great to me"
32,5.0,Worth every penny
33,1.0,Poor quality microphone
34,1.0, Not suitable for a remote worker taking calls
35,1.0," If your job requires dictation or a high quality mic, go elsewhere"
36,4.0,Got it for my wife’s birthday
37,4.0," Since XS doesn’t have the old headphone plugs, AirPods work perfectly"
38,4.0, More importantly she loves it
39,4.0, Sound effect is pretty good too
40,1.0,We bought a brand new set of AirPods for $159
41,1.0," After using them for a week, I was listening to them and the right air pod went dead"
42,1.0," I figured, maybe I just need to charge them"
43,1.0," So when I got home I charged them, and the next day I went to use them again and the right air bud was still dead"
44,1.0," So I did some research, tried to reset them, and then I couldn't reconnect them to my phone at all"
45,1.0,"Once I contacted Apple, they tried to give us the run around"
46,1.0," They wanted us to let them fully die, which makes sense, so we did that"
47,1.0," Then, when they still didn't work we wanted to exchange the faulty pair for a new set (BECAUSE WE PAID 159 DOLLARS AND ONLY USED THEM FOR A WEEK)"
48,1.0," Keep in mind, they were taken care of, not dropped, no water damage, they were expensive so they were treated delicately"
49,1.0," Apple wanted a $180 deposit to get a new set, which is MORE THAN WHAT I ORIGINALLY PAID FOR"
50,1.0,"I decided to contact Amazon, and they suggested contacting Apple, but once I explained what was going, on Amazon offered to make things right and send out a replacement"
51,1.0," Never had an issue with Amazon's customer service, but Apple was extremely disappointing"
52,1.0, I won't purchase these again
53,5.0,They are amazing
54,5.0, It's as simple as just opening the case and you're in
55,5.0, Sound quality isn't the best for headphones at this same price but the convenience is where you will be satisfied
56,1.0,Apple air
57,5.0,Can't get enough of these
58,5.0, The sound is improved compared to the regular apple headphones
59,1.0,right pod suddenly stopped working less than a week of purchasing and as well as case connectivity issues
60,1.0," i did not drop it or water damage it, seems to be a manufacturing defect"
61,1.0," Apple is replacing it for me, but it will take a week"
62,1.0,Do not buy
63,1.0, When they arrived they were in a box with not bubble wrap or anything
64,1.0, They connected to my phone for a few minutes and never connected again
65,1.0, Do not waist your money
66,5.0,Many customers are complaining that this is not the latest model
67,5.0, This is false
68,5.0, Apple released two configurations with the second generation AirPods
69,5.0, The first configuration is $160 and comes with the new H1 chip AirPods and a standard case (no LED on exterior)
70,5.0, The second is $200 and comes with the wireless case
71,5.0," This product page is for the new gen2 AirPods with standard case, hence $160"
72,5.0, You can check the serial number on Apple’s website and it will tell you that this is the latest model
73,1.0,THIS IS NOT THE LATEST MODEL
74,1.0, DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU WANT AIRPODS 2
75,1.0," Also, mine did not work"
76,1.0, They never paired and I feel like Amazon is scamming people by selling these as if they were in fact the latest model
77,1.0,Edit: The second pair just came in and they are absolutely disgusting
78,1.0," If anyone at Amazon looked at these and thought it was okay to ship the product in this condition, I would be surprised"
79,1.0, Please look at the pictures I attached
80,1.0, I have never been so displeased at a product/company
81,1.0," There's earwax on the headphones, dust and dirt all over the insides, and so on"
82,1.0, I reiterate - do NOT buy this product
83,1.0,This is not the wireless charging model this is not even the (latest version) I bought these thinking they where the newest version 2 AirPods with charging case this is not the case
84,5.0,"Al parecer lo que pasa es que el título del producto esta mal traducido al español e incluye la frase ""funda de carga inalámbrica"" lo cual no es correcto, ya que al comprarlo es la funda normal que solo tiene carga con cable"
85,5.0,"Esto se puede comprobar cambiando el idioma de amazon a Ingles y notando que el título del producto cambia y ya no incluye el ""Wireless charging"" que deberia de tener"
86,5.0,Lo dejo como un comentario que espero retroalimente y aclare a las personas que piensan comprarlos y ojala que amazon y apple corrijan este error de traducción
87,1.0,"Did not work , very unimpressed with how they didn’t work the left headphone did not work at all , i didn’t drop them or anything straight out of the box and they weren’t working"
88,4.0,"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money"
89,4.0," If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either"
90,4.0, The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5
91,4.0,0 vs 4
92,4.0,1 (Gen 1)
93,4.0," The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s)"
94,4.0, This particular item for $139
95,4.0,00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case
96,4.0, This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port
97,4.0, The wireless charging case model is $169
98,4.0," Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can"
99,4.0, Apple does sell it separately
100,4.0," If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here"
101,4.0,"Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid"
102,4.0," No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets"
103,4.0, You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device
104,4.0," So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience"
105,4.0,Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal
106,4.0," Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all"
107,4.0, Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit
108,4.0, I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information
109,4.0," Also, for Android users"
110,4.0, The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase
111,4.0,"Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case"
112,4.0, The case itself is a battery pack with a life
113,4.0," So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up"
114,4.0, Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening
115,4.0," I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time"
116,4.0,Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product
117,4.0, This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer
118,4.0," This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included"
119,4.0,AppleCare: It's $29
120,4.0,00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money
121,4.0," You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection"
122,4.0," We get it, accidents happen"
123,4.0, But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU
124,4.0, There is no additional fees or deductibles involved
125,4.0,AppleCare tips:
126,4.0,You don't have to install AppleCare right away
127,4.0, You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible
128,4.0,You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29
129,4.0,00 provided you want to keep the same product
130,4.0," If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product"
131,4.0,You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods
132,4.0,Using AirPods with Android:
133,4.0,Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth
134,4.0,If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device
135,4.0," You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect"
136,4.0," Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect"
137,4.0,FAIR WARNING:
138,4.0,You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device
139,4.0, You will be limited on functions you can perform
140,4.0,I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1
141,4.0,"99 called ""AirPopUp"""
142,4.0, It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted
143,4.0, Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network
144,4.0," There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more"
145,4.0,"For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds"
146,4.0," They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109"
147,4.0,99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods
148,4.0,Galaxy Buds features:
149,4.0,Made by Samsung
150,4.0,Audio powered by AKG
151,4.0,Rubber ear bud tips
152,4.0,Pair with Samsung device to get the most
153,4.0,Wireless charging case
154,4.0,Active noise cancellation
155,4.0,Comes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)
156,4.0,Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips
157,4.0,"I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"""
158,4.0," This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs"
159,4.0,"Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised"
160,1.0,I've had these air pods for a little under 2 weeks and having a very tough time connecting the air pods to my phone for calls
161,1.0, Multiple issues
162,4.0,I have both the AirPods and the Jabra Elite Actives
163,4.0, I like them both but for different reasons
164,4.0,AirPods Pros

182,4.0, Hope you will never have to use it
183,4.0, I had to return two before I got a pair that worked
184,4.0, THANK YOU AMAZON
185,4.0,"If I had to buy just one, it would be the AirPods"
186,4.0," But, the Jabras are better in the gym or in noisy environments"
187,3.0,"I was spectacle at first buying these online and not at an Apple store, but they are the newest model of airpods"
188,3.0," Unfortunately, the charging case that came with it, is actually the case that comes with the original airpods"
189,3.0," The new case has the LED on the outside, not on the inside and the Bluetooth pairing button on the back, is supposed to be in the middle of the case, not any lower"
190,3.0," These are the new airpods, however, it came with the old case for the original airpods"
191,3.0,"Although the 2nd generation AirPods came out in March 2019, improvements are merely incremental"
192,3.0," At the $100 price point, can the recently released Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 compete"
193,3.0, Read on to learn how the more expensive latest $140 Apple AirPods stack up versus Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro:
194,3.0,QUICK SPOILER ANSWER ANKER VS
195,3.0, APPLE AIRPODS:
196,3.0,Yes indeed
197,3.0," At $40 less, the Anker boasts equal sounds and noise cancellation not offered by Apple unless upgrading to the $250 Pro model"
198,3.0, The Apple AirPod 2 is the perennial best seller in this price range
199,3.0, You won’t be disappointed unless you need the awesome feature of noise cancellation
200,3.0, The $100 Anker is very well spent and does includes noise cancellation and an equalizer to balance the sound to your taste
201,3.0,SOUND QUALITY
202,3.0,I specialize in tech reviews and place the far highest priority on listening quality
203,3.0," If it’s better mic quality you are after, or have hearing difficulty, the AirPods are a bit better, capturing more-subtle voice tones"
204,3.0," But for music, the Anker equals Apple’s impressive sound"
205,3.0," Once you nail the fit, both will impress all but audiophiles in all aspects of sound quality: accuracy, tonal range, non-fatiguing, and punchy (but not annoying) bass"
206,3.0,"Speaking of bass, Anker does punch it up"
207,3.0," The highs are slightly rounded off, the midrange is fairly flat, and the low end is boosted"
208,3.0,NOISE CANCELLATION: Apple vs
209,3.0, Anker
210,3.0,This Apple model has none unless you spring for the newest $250 Pro version
211,3.0," For a lower price, the Anker’s have it, and do a worthy job"
212,3.0, This feature alone lets Anker win the race vs
213,3.0, the lastest Apple AirPod
214,3.0," If you haven’t experienced noise cancellation in headphones, or earbuds, you’ll likely be as blown away as I was"
215,3.0, I got my first noise cancelation Bose headphones six years ago when they were the only game in town
216,3.0," Life changing, truly"
217,3.0, A must for any noisy environment and a godsend for rest on long airplane trips
218,3.0,"The Anker’s were my second noise cancelling earbuds, and while not spectacular like the class leading $250 Sony’s, the result is satisfying"
219,3.0, I urge you to audition this feature
220,3.0," When making, phone calls, you may prefer it off"
221,3.0,CONTROLLING THE SOUND: APPLE VS
222,3.0, THE ANKER EQUALIZER APP:
223,3.0,"With the Apple AirPods, open Settings, Tap Music, and then EQ under the Playback tab"
224,3.0," Although the Soundcore Liberty 2 boosts the bass, some of us prefer a more nuanced and balanced sound"
225,3.0, With either of the new Anker’s the app is a terrific add on
226,3.0, You can get the sound balanced to your tastes easily
227,3.0,ADDITIONAL EARBUD REVIEWS COMPARISONS:
228,3.0,"If tempted to spend another $100 for the Apple AirPods Pro, have a look at my detailed review of the awesome Sony’s compared with the Apple AirPod:"

232,3.0,ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T81554H
233,3.0,SHOULD YOU SPEND MORE
234,3.0, VALUE AND OVERALL BEST CHOICE:
235,3.0,"Although only released in December 2016, the “age” of the AirPod technology is showing"
236,3.0," If you can spend more, in late 2019 Apple released it’s latest Airpods Pro"
237,3.0, At nearly double the price these hit a “whole ‘nuther level” for Apple to compare closely with the extraordinary high end Sony WF-1000XM3 at a similar $250+ price
238,3.0,If you can spend $200+ Sony the new Sheriff in town and in my opinion beats even the newest $250 Apple AirPods
239,3.0," However, at $100, the Anker’s impress and are better than the basic Apple AirPods with one great advantage: noise cancellation"
240,3.0," If you don’t like the black color, go with the sleek and now classic $150 Apple model"
241,3.0,Thanks for slogging through this long review
242,3.0, Hope it has helped your important buying decision
243,3.0,NOW TIME TO RELAX AND KICK UP THE JAMS
244,5.0,I have tried several “cheaper” imitations of AirPods and they were just ok
245,5.0," I have been waiting to get these and let me tell you, I’m sold"
246,5.0, THESE ARE GREAT
247,5.0," As soon as I got them, I had to try them out"
248,5.0," First of all, they paired with my iPhone XR, almost instantly"
249,5.0," All I had to do was have my phone open and near the AirPods, while they were still in the charging case, open the lid and within seconds they paired"
250,5.0," It displays the charge of both the AirPods and the case on your phone, too"
251,5.0, Super cool
252,5.0, I selected one of my favorite Classic Rock bands and started jamming
253,5.0, The sound quality was awesome
254,5.0," These have a excellent Bass response, too"
255,5.0, These were a outstanding purchase for me
256,5.0, I’m so glad that I patiently waited for the AirPod 2s
257,5.0, I had been reading a lot of expert reviews about them
258,5.0," The original AirPods are good I have heard, but for several improvements these are even better"
259,5.0, I definitely recommend them
260,5.0, I’m another satisfied listener and a very happy customer
261,5.0,I'm not really sure how helpful a review is at this point
262,5.0, Everyone who's going to buy AirPods already knows that they like them or not
263,5.0," Apple is releasing some AirPods with noise cancellation, I think that's the biggest complaint most people have: that they don't feel like they're deafened to the world around them"
264,5.0, But everytime someone comes into my office I have to stop the music or take the AirPods completely out of my ears to hear them clearly
265,5.0, The sound quality is decent
266,5.0, I'm no audiophile so to me they sound great
267,5.0," They also are easy to lose, but so are any other tiny cordless in-ear earphones"
268,5.0, Just keep track of them and you should be good to go
269,5.0, At first they hurt my ears so I bought some silicone covers with wingtips
270,5.0," They helped the AirPods stay in my ears without moving around and ""softened"" the edges of the earphones"
271,5.0," I guess they stretched my ears out or I just got used to wearing them, because now even without the silicone covers they fit and feel just fine"
272,5.0," The battery life is pretty good, and popping them back in the case for 10-15 minutes boosts them almost back up to full"
273,5.0, So I'll wear them at work and then if I get up to grab a drink or use the bathroom I'll give the AirPods a quick charge and be good to go the rest of the day
274,5.0, At first double-tapping to get them to pause or skip a song was frustrating but there's a tutorial online somewhere that shows you where to tap to get consistent results: just above the neck of the AirPods
275,5.0," They pair immediately with your iPhone and I've never had any connectivity issues or sound quality issues, so I'm very happy with my purchase"
276,1.0," I ordered these ""Original Apple AirPods"" for my girlfriend as a birthday present"
277,1.0," I was super excited for her, but to my surprise, as soon as the package arrived I saw there was something wrong"
278,1.0," Immediately looking at the box (see pictures and video) containing the ""AirPods"" I could tell this was not an original apple product (no apple logo, or serial number)"
279,1.0, Once I opened the colored box I could confirm that I was right on my assumption
280,1.0,"I already contacted Amazon but I live in the Dominican Republic and I know I can't return packages to the US, so I'm stuck with some cheap knock offs, I will never use, which I paid more than 130+ Dollars"
281,1.0,All of this is very annoying
282,1.0," I did NOT buy it through a third party seller, specifically because I wanted to avoid this situation"
283,1.0," I'm very upset I got ""tricked"" into buying what I thought was an original product (paid in full as an original) sponsored by Amazon"
284,1.0,This is a waste of money
285,1.0, After having the AirPods for 1 week the left side decided to stop working
286,1.0, I contacted support and was told I have to pay $69 to get just the left AirPod replaced
287,1.0, Seeming as I just spent $150 to buy them in the first place you can imagine my frustration
288,1.0, Don’t waste your money on these cheap no good AirPods
289,1.0,Right bud stop working after two months with normal use and no damage
290,1.0, Tried different way to reset the device still cannot make it work
291,1.0," Contacted with amazon custom service, first get transfer to apple custom service, being told that need to pay $75 to repair, later amazon customer service helped to fully refund"
292,1.0,"Did a little bit research online, the quality control for airpods 2 is very bad"
293,1.0, Many people reported different problems
294,1.0,"Although the product is fine but with this quality control, buying airpods 2 is just like buying lottery"
295,5.0,Great product
296,5.0, Sounds good
297,5.0, Connected to both my Android and iPhone
298,5.0, Siri works good with these
299,1.0,I got them and went to try them out and then one of the AirPods was broken
300,1.0,Will not stay in your ears
301,1.0, Also one will not come on now and is not charging properly
302,4.0,Good headphones if you Primarily work with apple products
303,4.0, Not a lot to offer if you are Android user
304,4.0, I have bought this for my work phone - doesn't last 5 hours even when listening to at less than 50% volume
305,4.0, Case has enough juice to charge this 2-3 times
306,4.0, Quick Charging is good
307,4.0, I put in case for 15-20mins and I am good for next 3-4 hours
308,1.0,I just received these thinking they were the Apple AirPods 2 (as description says latest model)
309,1.0, I received the first generation pods which I already had
310,1.0, Very disappointed - there was almost a month long wait
311,1.0, I was so excited to get to mailbox after work today
312,1.0,womp womp
313,5.0,Excelente 
314,5.0, tenía mis dudas por los malos comentarios 
315,5.0, pero responderé a las dudas de todos 
316,5.0, son originales
317,5.0,nuevos sellados 
318,5.0, la serie 2 
319,5.0,muchos no entiendes qué hay dos modelos uno con carga inalámbrica y otro con cable 
320,5.0, y este con cable cuesta menos 
321,5.0, y están en oferta por Amazon 
322,5.0, quien los vende y envía 
323,5.0, tienen garantía por Amazon y por apple de un año que la activas luego de la compra y empieza a correr 
324,5.0, envío rápido y confiable 
325,5.0," las malas críticas son vendedores de eBay,tiendas y personas que no leen bien o no sabe lo que pidieron a esos que los piden usados "
326,5.0, me duran 3 horas o más con música 
327,5.0, nunca los e descargado completo ya que me termino cansando 
328,5.0, no creo alguien necesite mas 
329,5.0, aparte de ser así con 15 minutos en la caja tienes una carga completa 
330,5.0, encantado 
331,5.0, los recomiendo
332,4.0,"I am not an Apple fanatic, but I have been using their devices since ios 3G"
333,4.0," I do not “jump” at any product they sell, nor do I live for the next upgrade"
334,4.0," heck, if it were up to Apple we would all give them our old devices and buy their next big thingy every 1"
335,4.0,5 years
336,4.0," Having said that, I waited to get the AirPod 2 and was exited to see an Amazon “sale” of the “latest model”, that is until I received them and found that only the pods are the latest model"
337,4.0, the charging case is the old case with the battery indicator light on the inside of the case
338,4.0, This detail could have easily been provided in the description of the item for the consumer to determine if that would be a deal breaker
339,4.0," but nope, buyer beware"
340,4.0,"The air pods fit perfectly for me, and the sound is rich & full, so once my music starts playing I get over the fact that I was hood winked by seller"
341,4.0, The transaction was excellent with the exception of the non disclosure of the old charging case
342,1.0,Purchased Apple AirPods (Latest Model) through Amazon
343,1.0, Left AirPod didn't work
344,1.0, Took them to local Apple store
345,1.0, They couldn't get it to work either
346,1.0, Returned them per Amazon's return policy on 4/29
347,1.0, 10 days later and no updates
348,1.0," So far, not so good"
349,5.0,I received my package in two days
350,5.0, When I first tried them out it right away connected to my phone
351,5.0," I’m very impressed with the sound these airpods provide, I was worried that I didn’t get the right ones at first because it didn’t have a led light in the front, but later I found out that the led on the outside is only for the wireless charger, I will definitely buy again, I’m very pleased"
352,5.0,"I also was a little worried because I saw some reviews that others left that they got fakes, but I’m telling you right now you have nothing to worry about, they are 100% real and worth your money"
353,1.0,So first off I wanna say I do love these AirPods
354,1.0, But
355,1.0, I have only had mine less then 3 months and the left one has totally stopped working
356,1.0, The case and my phone won’t even recognize that a left one even exists
357,1.0, And the case seems to loose all its charge very fast
358,1.0, All things that should not be happening form a apple product only 3 months old
359,1.0, It has got very frustrating since I use them for work
360,1.0, If it wasn’t for all that I would have given a much higher rating
361,1.0, I plan on talking to amazon and apple
362,1.0, Something has to be done about this
363,1.0, I looked thew the other reviews and this is not the first case of ether of these issues
364,1.0, I will update this once I have a chance to talk to them
365,5.0,They are original
366,5.0, I compared them to the ones that my coworker had bought from apple and they are legit
367,5.0, They were NOT dirty ( I was afraid of that being an issue since I read other reviews complaining about it ) but not my case
368,5.0, They came super quick and nice and properly sealed
369,5.0," Charger, case and AirPods brand new out of the box"
370,5.0, I’m very happy with this purchase
371,5.0, Have been using it 24/7 and the battery life is awesome
372,5.0, Can’t be happier
373,1.0,broke within a week
374,1.0, Didn't expect this kind of quality from Apple
375,1.0,Received today after waiting for backordered product
376,1.0, These are the original AirPods and not the AirPods 2
377,1.0, No wireless charging
378,1.0, Exactly the same as the first version
379,1.0, Disappointed that the description did not match the product
380,5.0,This is my first pair of wireless headphones (coming from the lightning pods) and the convenience is literally easier than plugging in a wire for audio
381,5.0, The literal second you take an AirPod out it will be connected to whichever device you choose
382,5.0, The audio quality is amazing
383,5.0, Cranking the knob to the max and the pods handle heavy bass tracks very well in circumference while tying treble to clarity amongst very busy audio
384,5.0, If you have an iWatch with cellular then you literally don’t need your iPhone anymore
385,5.0, Amazing
386,2.0,Very misleading
387,2.0, These are not AirPod 2 gen but the older model
388,5.0,I have been an anti-Apple/Android advocate for as many years as I can remember - Until Now
389,5.0," After lots of opinions from friends and colleagues I decided to take the plunge and spend some of my hard earned cash on ""the fruit's"" hottest new product - enter Airpods"
390,5.0, These things are AWESOME
391,5.0, The technology in the small package is just mind blowing
392,5.0, I run/exercise every morning and work from home so I can use these in every aspect of my daily lift and they never seem to run out of juice
393,5.0," Some have stated sound quality is not up to ""X"" product but seriously"
394,5.0, Considering what features are packaged into these little pods I would argue they are better than anything you compare against them and they do it at a fraction of the cost
395,5.0, Audiophiles might stick their nose in the air but these things deliver great sound
396,5.0," You can compare them to a litany of Bluetooth wireless headphones which may be better in a certain aspect, but all of the other options give up features that these contain"
397,5.0, My one complaint/recommendation for those that are worried about fitment or rigorous movement is to snag some of the Earbuddyz skins
398,5.0, They dramatically helped keep these things planted while I am running each morning and also add a little bit more noise cancellation
399,5.0, A+ Apple
400,5.0,Well done
401,1.0,If you look in the pictures the ones on the left are bigger
402,1.0, those are real airpods from the Apple store
403,1.0, DO NOT BUT THESE
404,1.0,You can’t use them if they don’t stay in your ears
405,1.0, I guess my ears aren’t compatible with these
406,1.0," They start out ok, then through natural movement (not running or bouncing), they just get really loose"
407,1.0," Haven’t had them fall out, but when they just hang on your ears the sound is crap"
408,1.0,I bought two pairs for my twins and my daughter has complained about using them with amazon music to where it would mess with the singers voice
409,1.0, I contacted the help desk and he blaimed Apple when I have already checked with Apple saying it was amazon's problem since I had bought them from Amazon
410,1.0, No worth the $160
411,1.0, I talked to Shahid from the help desk and he was absolutely no help
412,1.0, Thanks Amazon for this huge problem
413,5.0,"Por ahora el producto funciona perfectamente y es de buena calidad llego súper rápido, estoy satisfecha con la compra "
414,5.0,It’s a great product
415,5.0,I love my new AirPods
416,5.0, I was told my order would take two weeks to get to me but amazon prime is awesome and I received them within 4 days
417,5.0, The AirPods are the real deal
418,5.0," I saw some reviews about knockoffs being sent, not sure what that was about but my order was correct"
419,5.0, They were insanely simple to connect to my phone and then I was able to have them connected to my other devices as well
420,5.0, The battery life is perfect too
421,5.0, I especially like how placing them back into the case charges them when not using them
422,5.0, You don’t have to actually have the case plugged into the wall to charge them
423,5.0,If you were thinking about upgrading to the new AirPods stop thinking and start doing
424,5.0, There new AirPods are everything you will ever need in a pair of headphones
425,1.0,I thought these were new when I bought them
426,1.0," They were packaged as if they were new, but as soon as I used them, they would die very fast and would disconnect randomly"
427,1.0," Also, when talking to someone on the phone, they would send robotic or they would say I sounded weird and it would stop working and go to the phone"
428,1.0, This is the second pair I have owned my first pair my son currently has and has zero issues
429,1.0," Needless to say, these are refurbished, buyer beware"
430,5.0,these do not live up to the hype
431,5.0," the airpods do not fit in my ears, they don’t have any sort of noise canceling, and the most i’ve gotten out of two pairs is three months of regular use"
432,5.0, the first pair only lasted a month
433,5.0, i sent them back under warranty and they sent me a new pair
434,5.0, and yesterday ( May 9) the right airpod blew out
435,5.0, these lasted only three months
436,5.0, i’ve had a pair of beats solo 2 for almost three years
437,5.0, these are also technically an apple product and i am disappointed in the amount of time that these expensive listening devices last
438,5.0, i refuse to believe that this is a coincidence because i have had two identical pairs and both resulted in the same outcome
439,5.0,"These are the best pair of wireless earphones I ever came across, apple has definitely done it again"
440,5.0," Being an apple fan, I love these"
441,5.0, They are so easy to connect
442,5.0," Once I connected them to my iPhone, they were seamlessly connected to my other apple devices"
443,5.0, All I have to do is select them in the list from the device you need them to connect and you are good to go
444,5.0," Another good thing is turning them on/off is easy, just remove them from the charging case and they turn on and put them back to turn them off, its simple"
445,5.0," And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device"
446,5.0,"You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy"
447,5.0," Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback"
448,5.0,"The battery life is definitely impressive, I need to charge the case every 2 days"
449,5.0," And it's easy to carry everywhere, it being so small"
450,5.0,"Now the sound quality is crisp and connection is smooth, I found that the 2nd gen AirPods are actually better and improved on 1st gen, but its not worth to upgrade, but if you are planning to get your first one, I would definitely say go for the 2nd gen AirPods, I got a pretty sweet deal on amazon and am very happy with my purchase"
451,1.0,Literally just got these
452,1.0, The set up was super easy
453,1.0, The sound quality is $5 basic
454,1.0, Ok well maybe $10 basic
455,1.0, The only good thing is that they are truly wireless
456,1.0, I dont like how they fit in my ears
457,1.0, Only one AirPod work while watching YouTube videos
458,1.0, I can actually max out my volume and desire to turn it up louder but it wont get any louder
459,1.0, The base is so faint practically non existent
460,1.0, Ive been bamboozled
461,1.0, This price is Apple high but the quality is not good
462,1.0, I fell for the hype
463,1.0, After I use these further I will come back and update my review but as of right now I can say they are more hype than good and definitely not worth the price
464,1.0,Disappointed
465,1.0, I wanted to love these AirPods
466,1.0, The sound is perfect
467,1.0, Zero complaints with the sound quality
468,1.0," However, these really hurt"
469,1.0, They should not cause you pain
470,1.0," When I say hurt, it is truly painful"
471,1.0, This is not a mild discomfort
472,1.0," I tried to ignore it the first day, but after a few tries it is miserable"
473,1.0," I tried barely placing them in my ear and adjusting it, it relieved some of the pain pressure but it still hurt"
474,1.0, They keep falling out too
475,1.0," So if you adjust it to barely go into your ear, hopefully you are not moving around and working out because these will fall out repeatedly disrupting your workout"
476,1.0, I am so surprised at how badly these AirPods have turned out to be
477,1.0, They are expensive
478,1.0," If I had known, I never would have spent this much money"
479,1.0, I saw others using them and just thought they would be great
480,1.0, THEY CAUSE PAIN AND FALL OUT REPEATEDLY
481,1.0, You would think that someone could design something better
482,1.0, I need to find something better
483,1.0, No sound is worth all of this suffering
484,1.0, My ears and head hurt hours after I remove these
485,1.0," Yes, it causes headaches"
486,1.0," It’s so sad, because they have terrific sound and they look cool too"
487,1.0, This is a BIG disappointment
488,1.0, My advice: Do NOT waste your money
489,4.0,I have always hate Apple earphones since they used to be inferior sound quality and and not comfortable to wear
490,4.0," However, they changed all these stereotypes when they released Earpuds and then followed Onkyo, they offered TWS airpods"
491,4.0," Good sound quality considering its price, CHEAP"
492,4.0, Highly competitive product
493,4.0,As a tech enthuast
494,4.0," I have purcahsed quite a lot of all different earphones, the TWS type"
495,4.0, I used to hate all wireless earphone but now they seems improved quite a lot
496,4.0," I have Sony WF-1000XM3, Master Dynamic MW07, countless all different Chinese brands model (One did impressed me but it did not last longer than 3 months and dead) plus 3 pairs of this Apple AirPods"
497,4.0, As well as some Senn and Bose products
498,4.0," Thus, I think I am 100% qualified to say something related to a product"
499,4.0,Pro:
500,4.0,1
501,4.0," Very easy to use, swip, double click and you have full control"
502,4.0, Very little learning cost
503,4.0, The easist one to use by far
504,4.0,2
505,4.0, Good sound quality
506,4.0," Apple used high efficiency code to encode and decode bluetooth signal, AAC"
507,4.0, It performs just like a pair of wired earphone
508,4.0, I think they can compete with Senn CX300II or so
509,4.0, Great
510,4.0,3
511,4.0," Tiny case, premium look and just right material used"
512,4.0,Con:
513,4.0,1
514,4.0, You would be very very easy to left it somewhere
515,4.0," As I said, I have purchased 3 times of this exact same product from Amazon"
516,4.0, Why
517,4.0," I lost it earlier last year, bought again in Black Friday and left somewhere a while befoe, it did not last more than a month"
518,4.0, And now I am getting my latest 3rd pair
519,4.0, What a funny thing to mention
520,4.0, Apple should consider to provide insurance to this product
521,4.0, lol
522,4.0,2
523,4.0, Poor noise cancellation function
524,4.0, I know it is only a passive NC earphone but Senn CX can do far better job than it
525,4.0, It just make no sense why Apple cannot improve it
526,4.0, Particualrly when I am also using a Sony ANC earphone
527,4.0, Hell and heaven difference
528,4.0,3
529,4.0, Short battery life
530,4.0, neither of the charging case or the earphone itself
531,4.0," They claims 4hours battery life but in real situation, you get up to 3hours which is far from enough"
532,4.0," For music enthuast, you should consider to have at least 2 pairs of them, then you can switch when you have to charge"
533,4.0,"PLUS, Comparing all my other earphones"
534,4.0," I think Apple is more like a good compromise combination, it excelled in some aspects like sound quality, signal but not that good in noise cancellation, or feel of this case(I prefer MW07 case much more than a plain plastic case made by Apple)"
535,4.0," But, for 139bucks, you really have an awesome deal"
536,4.0,"In a word, I recommend this product"
537,1.0,I would highly discourage you from buying these air pods
538,1.0, I do not believe they are genuine Apple Air Pods
539,1.0, I could not get them to connect to anything
540,1.0," Not my iPhone, not my MacBook, nothing"
541,1.0, I tried for two day to try connecting and no results what so ever
542,5.0,These earbuds have been fantastic so far
543,5.0," People criticize the price, but I’m sorry, there is a reason for it"
544,5.0," I never tried the previous version, but these ones connect to my iPhone, iPad, and bluetooth transceiver almost instantly"
545,5.0, They are very comfortable and stay in my ears with no issues
546,5.0," I’ve tried cheaper bluetooth earbuds, in the 50$ range, and the difference was night and day"
547,5.0, I would pay the extra 100$ on these every day for the increase of build quality and performance
548,5.0,There seems to be a lot of confusion about how the seller is offering these for this price and whether or not these are first generation or second generation
549,5.0, I believe I can help to quickly/easily clear up some of the confusion
550,5.0, These are indeed genuine Apple products
551,5.0," They arrived sealed in the box, they appear to be in brand new condition, the serial numbers match/check out, and I am pleased with what I received for the price"
552,5.0," That said, these are in fact second generation (newest version of this older style) EARBUDS"
553,5.0," but the CASE is in fact the *first generation*, or, the older version of this style of earbuds"
554,5.0," That means no light on the front of the case, and no wireless charging"
555,5.0," I do not wirelessly charge my earbuds, I use a cord so it does not bother me"
556,5.0, This does come with the Apple lightning cable to charge them
557,5.0," All of these things aside, the ad itself claims that the case itself is a 2nd generation as well, which is a straight up lie"
558,5.0," So for this reason, I had initially left a 3 out of 5 star review, until I was at Costco today (2/2/2020) and saw the *exact* same thing"
559,5.0," gen 2 AirPods, sold as gen 2 AirPods, in a gen 1 case"
560,5.0,"no light, no wireless charging, comes with a charging cord, for the exact same price"
561,5.0, hell maybe this seller *is* Costco
562,5.0," either way, I changed my review to 5 stars so I could sleep at night"
563,5.0, Thanks seller
564,1.0,These are not the newest version 😡
565,1.0,AirPod 2
566,1.0,0 are the “latest model”
567,1.0, Sadly some customers will be unaware that they were sold 1
568,1.0,0 AirPods for the price of 2
569,1.0,0 AirPods
570,1.0, This s
571,1.0,elle
572,1.0,r should not be trusted
573,5.0,The Good:
574,5.0,-Much faster connection and switching between devices than original Airpods
575,5.0,-Longer battery life
576,5.0,-Can say “Hey Siri” versus double tapping on the original Airpods
577,5.0,-Stylish
578,5.0,-Great sound and microphone works well
579,5.0,-Fits well in ear
580,5.0,-Incredibly easy to use and pair
581,5.0,-Charging case Charges Airpods quickly and reliably
582,5.0,-Can track last location of Airpods with Find iPhone
583,5.0,The Bad:
584,5.0,-A bit expensive but Airpods work the bets with iOS devices
585,5.0,The Bottom Line:
586,5.0,I own both the original and latest model of the Airpods and I think it is worth upgrading from the original Airpods
587,5.0, The new H1 chip is SO much faster for connecting to your device and switching between devices
588,5.0, I use these all the time and the speed of connecting to devices and the longer battery life are worth it to me
589,5.0, I also like being able to say “Hey Siri” on the latest model Airpods versus double tapping on the original models
590,5.0, Most everything else hasn’t changed as the look is the same and the charging case is the same
591,5.0, I did not get the wireless charging case as I thought it was a bit expensive
592,5.0, The sound is still fantastic and the microphone works great (I use these to talk to clients a lot during the day)
593,5.0, I like the look of the Airpods compared to some of the other options out there (the Bose ones stick out of your ears pretty far which to me seems strange)
594,5.0," Overall, I would recommend either purchasing these latest Airpods if you have an Apple device or upgrading from the original Airpods (for the speed of connecting to your devices alone)"
595,5.0,"***Update as of June 9, 2019"
596,5.0,My Airpod 2nd generation are still going strong and would still highly recommend
597,2.0,These don’t sound as good as everyone makes it out to be
598,2.0," Bass is too damn loud, and the overall sound is not as clear as the regular headphones with the strings"
599,2.0," Does not cancel noise, I am listening to them right now next to my running faucet and I can still hear the faucet even with the volume on maximum"
600,2.0," I will be only using this in the gym and on runs, they also feel bulky in my ears and no you will not forget they are in your ears like how everyone has said"
601,3.0,"Estuvieron funcionando bien pero la batería no duraba mucho y en la 2 semana de haberlos comprado el audífono derecho empezó a hacer un ruido horrible y no solo lo escuchaba yo,sino con quien estaba hablando tambien,asi que los devolví"
602,3.0," Pero si tenían buen sonido y son muy cómodos, a lo mejor fue el mío que vino defectuoso ,no digo que todos hagan lo mismo"
603,5.0,These Apple Airpods are probably the best earbuds i’ve ever used
604,5.0, It is very useful for social media and mainly music
605,5.0, I consider you guys to but this because it is probably better than the first generation
606,5.0, Mark my words
607,5.0, I want to thank amazon for the fast delivery
608,1.0,The only reason I am giving one star is because
609,1.0,"I ordered these airpods, and when I opened the box (the white airpods box) there were NO AIRPODS IN IT"
610,1.0, THE AIRPODS AND CHARGING CASE WERE GONE
611,1.0, It was just an empty box with the instructions manual and charging cable
612,1.0, I'm guessing someone at the Amazon facility got themselves a free set of Airpods
613,1.0,but I'm not 100% sure what exactly happened
614,1.0, I contacted Amazon and they are supposed to be replacing them for me and I am supposed to receive them tomorrow
615,1.0," May just be a freak incident, but I wanted to put it out there"
616,1.0,"It says the latest model, but it is not the latest model"
617,1.0,It is the first model actually
618,5.0,I originally never thought I’d own these
619,5.0, I have several Apple products and try to buy other brands just so I don’t come across an an Apple fanatic (I'm actually somewhat critical of them)
620,5.0," I also always want to know if the grass is greener, I want to own the best gadgets regardless of who makes them :) I own Bose Soundsport free and a couple pairs of Zolo liberty plus"
621,5.0, I also have used an Anker set with the wire between the buds
622,5.0,"The AirPods, while I have experienced bugs over the years"
623,5.0, they are the most robust Bluetooth connection I’ve used
624,5.0, They literally NEVER cut out when using under normal conditions
625,5.0," I bought the first generation ones because I like that they are small and white, fits perfectly under a hair net that I have to wear in clean rooms for work"
626,5.0, Can listen to my tunes and most people won’t even notice I’m wearing em
627,5.0," I have put dozens of yards of space between me and my phone, several tall metal machines that one would think should interfere with the connection"
628,5.0, It amazes me how solid they are
629,5.0,"Now, I won’t use these for working out as I sweat quite a bit and I’m certain they’ll fall right out"
630,5.0, I think the Bose ones are the most secure for working out
631,5.0,Battery life is pretty good when they are new
632,5.0, After a year or two you will notice that it declines (based on my experience with the gen1 version)
633,5.0, The battery case could definitely have more juice
634,5.0," When compared to the amount of charges you can get with the Zolo’s, puts the AirPods and the Bose to shame"
635,5.0,People like to complain about the sound quality and sometimes about the lack of noise cancellation
636,5.0," But I find that they sound really good, granted I’m not really a sound snob"
637,5.0, easy to please
638,5.0, IMO neither the Bose or the Zolo sound any better
639,5.0,Regardless of what some are saying there is a few improvements between 1st and 2nd gen
640,5.0,"In the second gen, Apple uses a H1 chip which helps with stabilizing connecting issues which 1st gen users experienced"
641,5.0, It's also much faster at connecting to your phone and switching between devices
642,5.0, The 1 gen were terribly slower
643,5.0,"Secondly, there's the siri function"
644,5.0, Not much more to compare about
645,5.0, 1st gen didn't have this function
646,5.0,Battery life
647,5.0," Is the same, cannot tell the difference"
648,5.0,Overall great headphones
649,5.0," Not really worth the upgrade if you recently purchased the 1st gens but, if you didn't definitely worth it"
650,1.0,"The only reason this review has a one star is because upon arrival of these apple airpods, there is evidence of someone wearing them before"
651,1.0, When opening the package in my room I took out the headphones and I notice there was ear wax on the right headphone
652,1.0, I am disgusted that someone has wore these headphones and was careless to even clean the evidence of it
653,1.0, I am very disappointed and disgusted that I got a product that is dirty with someone else’s earwax without it being cleaned if someone was to wear these “new” AirPods before being shipped and packaged
654,1.0,Got an empty box
655,1.0,Read the recent reviews
656,1.0,I got it refunded and bought one directly from apple
657,5.0,I recently had bought these airpods
658,5.0," After buying I had checked the reviews, a lot of reviews said they were fake"
659,5.0, In the comments it was very controversial whether they were fake or not
660,5.0, Some believed they were and others believe they weren't
661,5.0, You can check to see if they are real if you go to checkcoverage
662,5.0,apple
663,5.0,com this is a site runned by apple
664,5.0, The site is used for you to fill in your serial number (which can be found on one of the thinner sides of the box on a sticker
665,5.0, You type in your serial number and it will tell you what generation you have and whether it is a valid and real
666,5.0, Mine came up as real and also showed my 2 year apple care warranty too
667,5.0," I believe many people thought it was fake because when you first connect them it's name comes up as ""Me's Airpods,"" However, you can change the name"
668,5.0," People probably also typed in the wrong serial number, the serial number validation site is very key sensitive"
669,5.0, Many sites say the serial number is the model number which is incorrect
670,5.0," The serial number is extremely long and complicated, whereas the model type is shorter and less complicated"
671,5.0," If you look at the top of this product you can see the store selling these airpods are called ""Apple store"" If this was a fake apple site amazon would have said or shut the site down already"
672,5.0, Amazon knows when shops are fake or claim to be something they aren't
673,5.0, Amazon would have been sued by now if these were actually fake
674,5.0, Another way to know if your airpods are fake is to check if you can find them on Find My Iphone
675,5.0, If your airpods are connected to phone and you have everything set up it should pop up
676,5.0, If they were fake they wouldn't show
677,5.0," However, you have to make sure your airpods are connected to your phone and everything is set up so you airpods can be found on find my iphone"
678,2.0,i got these ear buds because they say they will pair fine with an android phone
679,2.0, they do-- about 20 percent of the time
680,2.0, they often stop working randomly-- one ear will just stop working
681,2.0, or both
682,2.0,most of the time they simply don't operate like standard ear buds
683,2.0, i have a $40 set that works much better
684,1.0,I really want to like them
685,1.0, They're supposed to be effortlessly convenient to pair and use for all your Apple devices while sounding and looking good
686,1.0, But they're not
687,1.0,they're none of that
688,1.0, Let me explain:
689,1.0,"Sound - it's ok, really"
690,1.0, No seal so you hear all the ambient noise around you which is good and bad depending on the situation
691,1.0," Not much for bass extension, treble is flat but clear"
692,1.0, Adequate all things considered
693,1.0," If you've used the old design earpods, these are nearly the same sound profile"
694,1.0," On a plus, the microphones are very good"
695,1.0,Features - very little to say here
696,1.0, They're Bluetooth (5
697,1.0,"0) so they pair quickly and have long range, when they work (more on that later)"
698,1.0,"Battery Life - very good, a couple hours at high-ish volume on the pods and half a dozen charges per case charge"
699,1.0, More than I need for most situations
700,1.0,Functionality - 100% atrocious and I've had 3 sets of these (shame on me)
701,1.0, The case and charging system is so faulty it leads to numerous other problems with pairing and connecting both AirPods at the same time
702,1.0," The contact points in the case and on the pods where they charge easily loses connection, dirties, and later corrodes"
703,1.0, Using them for fitness around any sweat or moisture will speed up their inevitable failure
704,1.0," Once this happens, one pod will refuse to charge or stay connected when put back in the case, draining it's battery or trying to reconnect to different devices when in the case"
705,1.0," Even if they didn't suffer constant bugs, the pairing with multiple devices is equally buggy, frequently losing connection or trying to connect to other devices in the house for no apparent reason"
706,1.0,"As far as I can tell, AirPods Pro share the same charging design, so I will listen to my own advice and stay far away from these until the design is fixed"
707,1.0, I would advise you do the same
708,1.0,1 Star
709,1.0,I don't think these are genuine Apple Air Pods
710,1.0, People I know who have them don't have any of the problems I've had
711,1.0, See below
712,1.0,"• Frequently can’t perform functions asked through Siri, just says “working on it” then drops"
713,1.0," Ironically none of my non-apple earpieces have any trouble, ever, only Apple EarPods fail, often so I think they are knock offs"
714,1.0,"• unless you put them back in their case when you’re done using them they will continue to answer your phone, sometimes mid-call when you aren’t wearing them"
715,1.0," You can go to settings to turn them off, but every single other earpiece or headphone I've ever owned disconnects when you take them off"
716,1.0,• they are worthless if you are doing anything other than sitting still in one place
717,1.0, They fall out of my ears constantly and if I don’t have music playing at the time I don’t always notice and have to search for them
718,1.0," The newer version may be better, this version is a ridiculous, inexcusable design flaw"
719,1.0,•Since you can only recharge them or pair them with a devise when they’re in their case if you misplace the case you’re out of luck and buying a new one is not cheap
720,1.0,I purchased airpods (Gen2) for full price in April 2020 with the additional AppleCare protection plan
721,1.0, I am writing this in March 2021
722,1.0," Around Christmas time, these stopped working"
723,1.0, Because of the holiday season and having other earbuds I didn't bother going into an AppleStore to get them looked at
724,1.0,The Apple employee told me that the serial number on the case is not the same as the serial number he is getting from the earbuds
725,1.0, That the case also does not feel like it is the same apple quality
726,1.0, The lid is lighter than what you find in the Apple Stores
727,1.0,I looked at my Amazon invoice from my order history and found the serial number on that and plugged it into checkcoverage
728,1.0,apple
729,1.0,com
730,1.0, It was not listed
731,1.0," I plugged in the number on the bottom of my case, (it was different), this one came up and everything was expired"
732,1.0,I FEEL HORRIBLY CONNED
733,1.0, Looking at the amazon page it doesn't say you are buying from Apple
734,1.0, But it sure looks like it
735,1.0," They worked fine for the time I used them but if they are NOT Apple and the warranty is a SCAM, then why pay $125 something dollars for them"
736,1.0, WE ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF BY FAKES
737,3.0,I feel like I got scammed
738,3.0," Advertisement and the sale for the AirPods 2nd gen is as follows: one pair wireless charging more expensive, they second pair cheaper and plug in"
739,3.0, The way you choose your AirPods from this seller is the same so it’s easy to come to the assumption that both are 2nd gen
740,3.0, So I feel like the labeling was on purpose to sale (Obsolete merchandise) which cost me money and I ended up buying a product I didn’t want
741,3.0, I feel taken advantage of as a consumer I’ve never owned AirPods because they’re pricey however being that my iPad and my iPhone have different charging ports it’s hard to have just one pair of headphones for them I broke down and decided it was worth the convenience
742,3.0, Its sellers like this one that made me want to buy directly from the website and as soon as Amazon reopens it’s call center I plan to make a full complaint
743,3.0, Please know what you’re buying be careful today sellers will take Advantage of consumers With no sense of guilt after all it’s nothing but profit for them
744,3.0, I gave this product three stars because it is an Apple product it was in new condition although it was not what I thought I purchased
745,3.0," Don’t trust amazon to make sellers sell quality products, not everything you buy comes from them"
746,3.0, The pair I current own work fine but I just paid 140 plus tax for first generation
747,3.0, Get me once shame on you
748,5.0,THE SHORT REVIEW -
749,5.0,"If you are in the Apple universe, get these"
750,5.0,Don't bother wasting your time and money getting non-Apple pods
751,5.0, I already did that for you
752,5.0,THE LONGER REVIEW -
753,5.0,"I've had three other brands - two of them, very reputable ones - and had issues with all of them, ranging from connectivity to sound quality"
754,5.0," The biggest issue was with phone calls which sounded fine to me, but, judging from the complaints, not so much for those on the other end of the calls"
755,5.0,"Soooo, I finally bit the bullet on Prime Day and got real AirPods"
756,5.0," The minute I put them in, I could see and hear that there was no comparison"
757,5.0,WHY ARE THESE SO MUCH BETTER
758,5.0,— The sound quality is noticeably superior and connectivity is a dream
759,5.0,— The battery life is great and you can see how much power each pod has
760,5.0,— The case is the charger and it holds a charge for a very long time after it is unplugged
761,5.0, You can pop the AirPods into it and they recharge without having to be connected to anything
762,5.0,"— You can use Apple's ""Find My"
763,5.0,""" app to locate them if you misplace them"
764,5.0," The Find My app locates the case, not the pods, so I now keep the case in my pocket or purse when wearing the pods"
765,5.0," That way, when I take them out, I can put them in the case so that when I put the case down, it can be found wherever I've left it"
766,5.0,— You can choose to have Siri announce incoming calls and ask whether or not you want to answer each one
767,5.0," Every time I get a call, I think about how much I love that feature"
768,5.0,— Siri also reads to you the Messages that you get while wearing the pods
769,5.0,"— Using AirPods is generally intuitive, but do read the instructions to know what and how to tap to activate different functions"
770,5.0,"One little glitch is that, sometimes when I'm listening to music through the AirPods, I'll say something to my husband and Siri will think I'm talking to her and butt in"
771,5.0," It's a little annoying, but anyone who has a device with an ""assistant"" knows that that is part of the deal"
772,5.0,I got this version because my son has had them since they debuted and loves them
773,5.0, I saw no reason to pay more for features I probably wouldn't use
774,5.0, I love them
775,5.0, and I mean LOVE them
776,5.0,I cannot say how they work with non-Apple products because I only have Apple
777,5.0,THE BOTTOM LINE:
778,5.0,"As I stated at the beginning of this review, get these"
779,5.0, They have been worth every penny
780,5.0,Don't waste your time and money getting non-Apple pods
781,5.0, I already did that for you
782,1.0,I received this product with an awful buzzing noise coming from the left AirPod and the lid to my case shifted back and forth
783,1.0," I called Amazon, where their representative transferred me to someone from their Apple department"
784,1.0," I spoke to the Apple representative for what seemed like hours, the mister kept asking me the same questions to which I gave the same responses over and over again"
785,1.0," It was very frustrating, the product wasn’t even in my possession for 48 hours and it was already giving me immense problems"
786,1.0," The solution was to get the AirPod/case replaced and after telling me it would be free, the Apple representative said it would end up costing me around $60, just for the AirPod"
787,1.0, I was too frustrated to hear anymore and after hanging up I immediately started a return…
788,5.0,These are noise cancelling
789,5.0, I didn’t buy these thinking they were either
790,5.0, I’ve held off for this long not grabbing a set of wireless AirPods because the prices were OUTRAGEOUS
791,5.0,"These ended up costing me $100, and I was skeptical at first"
792,5.0, I heard mixed reviews and I wanted to try them myself to see if they were for me
793,5.0,I love them
794,5.0, The tapping feature helps me a lot since I’m always working in a clean room and if someone needs to speak to me tapping on them is a key component to conversing without having to constantly find my phone to pause what I’m listening too
795,5.0,Their ability to stay connected to my phone through Bluetooth is astounding
796,5.0, I can walk about 60ft away from my phone and still have clear sound through a closed door
797,5.0, It blew my mind
798,5.0,"I was concerned about them falling out, but now that’s a thing of the past"
799,5.0, They fit well and are so comfortable that sometimes I forget I have them in
800,5.0, I almost stepped into the shower with them on
801,5.0, That’s how comfortable they are
802,5.0,"Hate to say it but even though their prices are pretty high, they’re so well worth it"
803,4.0,"Given Apple’s price-quality continuum history, I had high expectations for this pricey set of earbuds"
804,4.0," Out of the box and after fully charging, I was amazed at how fast they paired with my iPhone7"
805,4.0," I have about 20 sets of earphones, ranging in price from the cheapo Monoprice to the Bose Sportsound"
806,4.0," So, I put them in my ear canals and headed out for my 3-mile loop"
807,4.0, I had expressed doubt that they would remain seated in my external auditory meatus while running
808,4.0, I had not gone 100m and the left one popped out and hit the pavement
809,4.0, This happened three more times before I was done
810,4.0, The right channel never moved
811,4.0, The sound quality was excellent
812,4.0, Not so great for excluding the ambient sound of passing cars
813,4.0," So, bottom line: great packaging"
814,4.0, Long play life
815,4.0, Excellent sound in environments where ambient noise is around 80dB
816,4.0," If your ears are like mine, you’ll likely be picking one of them off the ground"
817,4.0, The touch feature is great for taking phone calls
818,4.0," But, the Bose wins hands down for fit and exclusion of background noise"
819,4.0," Plus, you have a fail-safe wire connecting both buds, a comforting thought when riding a bike"
820,4.0, Who wants to retrieve a lost earbud when cranking along at 20mph
821,1.0,We bought these airpods on Amazon in July of 2020
822,1.0, They worked great until one of the ear pods stopped connecting
823,1.0, Only one pod worked
824,1.0," We had purchased the extended warranty and per Apple's instructions, we mailed the unit to them for repair and they sent it back, refusing to fix or replace, without explanation"
825,1.0,We then went to Home Depot and bought a pair of generic ear pods for $30 and they work great
826,1.0,I give this entire experience the lowest marks
827,1.0, Be wary and buyer beware of airpods and extended warranties sold on Amazon
828,1.0,"I normally rate things highly, but in this particular case, it did not work out for us"
829,1.0,The description of the item is not accurate
830,1.0, I received the item and noticed that the charging case is actually the 2017 model which doesn't do wireless charging
831,1.0," I asked for a replacement thinking that it must be a mistake, received the item again with the same old model"
832,1.0,Highly Disappointing
833,1.0," Just be aware that although the description says latest model, it really isn't"
834,5.0,I bought these to use with my Samsung and they work great
835,5.0,"To connect with android, turn on Bluetooth, open the lid and press the tiny button on the back (you'll see a blinking white light) until they connect"
836,5.0," It's a bit tricky to connect sometimes as they will turn off when I first try to connect but it's not a big deal because once they do, they won't disconnect again"
837,5.0,They're very comfortable and don't fall out of my ears
838,5.0, I don't have to constantly push them back into place
839,5.0, Sound is also great and the bass is on point
840,5.0," They come with a charging cable but no adapter, though I just use the one that came with my Android"
841,5.0, There are apps to keep track of battery but I don't use them
842,5.0, The Airpods will make a specific sound to notify me that it's time to charge
843,5.0,"If you have an Android and want Airpods, buy them"
844,5.0, You won't get all the features iPhone's get but it's totally worth it
845,5.0,I got these in the mail yesterday and could not wait to use them
846,5.0, They’re great
847,5.0," I love them so far; however, when I went to connect them to Bluetooth for the first time the name listed for the AirPods popped up as “Sugar Tits AirPods” lmao"
848,5.0, Ummmm i’m not sure exactly how this happened
849,5.0, Honestly I think It’s pretty funny and don’t really care but my only concern is I hope I didn’t pay full price and get used pods that someone else already named “Sugar Tits” lol
850,5.0, Maybe the guys at Apple were having some fun
851,5.0, So yea that’s my review on this lol
852,5.0, Weird as hell
853,5.0,"Storytime: this past winter while riding our quad through our back yard and around our property, I somehow dropped my white iPods out of my snowsuit into the WHITE snow"
854,5.0, It was about two foot deep in the low spots and the plow had mountains of it everywhere else over our heads
855,5.0," Needless to say, my efforts to find them were unsuccessful and I was in tears because I literally wore them all the time ( obviously if I felt the need to even take them outside with me then I wore my iPods excessively) and to me it was not logical to spend that much money on earbuds"
856,5.0, It was quite literally a splurge on myself that was not normally something I would ever do
857,5.0, So realizing they were gone when I used them daily reminded me how boring my life was before them
858,5.0," With them I was able to multitask and get my mundane daily chores, work tasks and also play mom and wife all while escaping into an audible book that made time pass so much more enjoyably"
859,5.0," I know this may sound minuscule to some but when your life is the same day after day after day, they really did save me from some depressive moments by allowing me to be productive but also do something I enjoy, AND THEY WERE GONE WITH THE BLIZZARD"
860,5.0," I cursed myself out and damned myself to the depths of hell for the rest of the day and even with all the heat I put myself under, the snow still stood strong when I awoke the next day and every day after that for the next 2 1/2 months"
861,5.0," Eventually I forgot, kind of"
862,5.0," I should say I moved on, lol"
863,5.0,Then one day came the 3rd week in March and my oldest daughter came to visit me
864,5.0, Are you guessing what I’m going to tell you
865,5.0, Yeah
866,5.0, You’re right
867,5.0, There in my thawed spring ready driveway sat a lonely case with two iPods inside
868,5.0, And that isn’t the best part
869,5.0," They still had a 3/4 charge and both work perfectly to this day, 4 months later"
870,5.0,"So, my point to those who made it this far"
871,5.0, (Nobody made it this far
872,5.0,) Buy them
873,5.0, You do not need a fancy wireless charging case or the fancy $200 plus dollar newer iPods with the noise cancellation
874,5.0," These are not built to withstand Michigan winters, yet they do"
875,5.0, Crazy but so amazing and funny
876,1.0,I just discovered after having these Airpods for many months that they are not genuine Apple AirPods
877,1.0, The serial number on the box does not match the serial number on the AirPods which does not match the serial number when I open my iphone and go to Settings>General>About and check the serial number
878,1.0, I kept wondering why these didn't quite feel the same in my ear as my first pair that I bought from Apple and later lost
879,1.0, Now I know
880,1.0, These are fake
881,1.0," Because I've had them since Sep 2019, I already know Amazon is going to do nothing"
882,1.0,•This air pods are not the 2nd generation they are the fist *DONT•BUY*
883,1.0,This product was marketed as the Airpod 2 but they sent me the old model
884,1.0," In addition, the item paired with my cellphone only once and never worked again"
885,1.0, I followed every tutorial possible to make sure I wasn’t screwing something up
886,1.0," I tried resetting the thing, resetting my iphone"
887,1.0, Never worked again
888,1.0, Don’t buy on here buy from Apple directly if you don’t want to get the old defective model after paying for the new model
889,1.0,Play Video
890,1.0, I bought these on Prime day and got them very quickly
891,1.0, I followed the easy instructions on how to pair with my phone and they were constantly connecting then disconnecting
892,1.0, I tried everything to get them to work
893,1.0," Reset my phone, reset the AirPods, turned off my wifi, disconnected other Bluetooth devices, etc"
894,1.0, Nothing worked
895,1.0, So I requested a replacement from Amazon
896,1.0,I got that replacement today and guess what
897,1.0, same issue
898,1.0, This time they keep flashing “Not Your AirPods” when trying to connect which makes me think I have used AirPods
899,1.0, I have an iPhone 11 Pro that isn’t even 6 months old so there’s no way it’s my phone
900,1.0, It’s fully updated so that’s not the issue either
901,1.0, I guess I’ll be returning these
902,1.0, I’m so pissed
903,1.0,I attached a video of them connecting/disconnecting
904,1.0,Isn’t the AirPods 2 supposed to be standard with wireless charging
905,1.0, False advertising if your saying “latest model”
906,1.0,"Update: after a bit of using them they started to malfunction, the syncing wasn’t matching up between the two headphones"
907,1.0, Then the left one stopped working entirely
908,1.0, From my experience I’d Buy from apples site so you know you’re getting the real thing
909,1.0," Super disappointed, especially in this seller for not reaching out"
910,1.0,They started to work again however the right one sounds don’t waste your money on this
911,1.0,We purchased these during Prime Day 2021 when they were on sale from $130 to $105 as limited time deal for Prime Day
912,1.0," No where in the description does it say they are “renewed”/refurbished/used, but they ARE USED"
913,1.0," They came with a label saying “Thanks to you, this product has a second life"
914,1.0,” See picture
915,1.0, This is false advertising
916,1.0," I can buy BRAND NEW ones at Costco right now for $129 NOT on sale, so why would I buy used ones for the same price"
917,1.0," Thanks to the false advertising, I’ve now missed any chance of buying new AirPods on sale during Prime Day"
918,1.0," Don’t buy unless you think it’s worth paying full price for a used product that someone else opened, put in their ears and programmed to their phone when you can get unused, unopened brand new AirPods for exact same price anywhere else"
919,5.0, These are very much so real and they fit perfect and sound perfect because me personally I like it when my music is blasting in my ears and I will say these are pretty good at blasting music they get loud but not unnecessarily loud and the base on them is pretty girlie and if you have them blasting music you can’t hear people at all so all around good product 👍🏾
920,5.0,"As someone who doesn't like splurging on things, I'm glad I bought these AirPods"
921,5.0," I spent weeks ordering about 2 or 3 different, cheaper wireless airbuds, (one of which I just gave away because the return cost was like $10 bucks) but I should've just went with the Apple AirPods to begin with"
922,5.0,I tested them by joining my friends on Discord and having them hear me
923,5.0, They said they could hear me clearly and the background noise wasn't noise at all
924,5.0," Whereas when I tested the other airbuds before, they would say I sounded muffled and breaking up"
925,5.0,"I almost never have an issue with them falling out of my ears when I take my dog for a walk, but I don't know about running with them"
926,5.0," I would probably prefer the AirPod Pros (but then again, not willing to upgrade if I don't need to)"
927,5.0, The battery on them is great
928,5.0, It can last hours depending on if you're talking on the phone or if you're listening to music and can last SEVERAL hours if you just continuously switch the AirPods from using left to right
929,5.0, I've used them every day for the past 7 months and (even though I've dropped them a few times from 5 feet high) they work just as well as when I first got them
930,4.0,The latest model when I bought this was a Gen 2 but I def got a Gen 1 set of airpods
931,4.0," However, they were marked down quite a bit and that makes a ton of sense to me"
932,4.0, If you're expecting to get Generation 2 airpods for this much cheaper then you're going to be disappointed
933,4.0, That being said the Gen 1s are perfectly fine and they work great
934,4.0, They don't have any sort of noise-canceling so don't expect that to be a thing
935,4.0, They do however sound pretty good and are very easy to use on a daily basis
936,4.0, I use them all the time for listening to music or watching TV on my phone
937,3.0,Let me start off by saying amazon is amazing with customer service
938,3.0,I had an issue with one of the pods going dead very quick compared to the left one
939,3.0,I called Apple they told me the steps to fix the issue but it didn’t help
940,3.0, They put a hold on my card of $75 and send out a new right bud only
941,3.0,"These are only about a week old and already having issues, I will not accept just replacement parts"
942,3.0, I expect a new unit
943,3.0,So I called amazon they issued me a full refund or exchange of a brand new unit with absolutely no additional holds on my card
944,3.0,Not only is Apple going down In quality there customer service is horrible
945,3.0, Rerouted to at least 8 different people before getting off the phone 3 hours later
946,3.0,Amazon took care of me without even a phone call
947,3.0, Good job Amazon
948,3.0, You just outshined Apple
949,5.0,"I'm not honestly a fan of Apple & the way they force some of their ideas on us, but in some cases, they're just unbeatable"
950,5.0," When you compare AirPods to every other product out there, nothing is easier to pair, works better or longer and more consistently than these"
951,5.0," I don't care about wireless charging myself, but having Bluetooth 5"
952,5.0,0 is a worthwhile improvement over the 1st gen for both range and power usage
953,5.0," For what it's worth, I don't think the sound quality is great for music, but they're just fine for conversations"
954,5.0,"Okay, so I bought these after my third pair of cheaper wireless headphones broke"
955,5.0, I was getting tired of ones that attached and had the cord that went around my neck
956,5.0," Hence, I decided to search the internet for the best headphones that would work for listening to music/audio books while working out or doing things around the house"
957,5.0," I finally decided to try out the AirPods since they had such great reviews, and because they were on sale"
958,5.0," When I received the AirPods, I was surprised at how well they actually fit in my ears"
959,5.0," I had worried about them falling out, and though they have fallen out a few times due to my children rough housing and landing on my head, they have worked great for walking around the house and exercising"
960,5.0," The sound quality is really amazing, and I am pleasantly surprised at how quickly they charge"
961,5.0," I will update this once I've had them longer than a few weeks, but I am extremely impressed with them so far"
962,5.0," I was extremely skeptical at first, but I'm very glad I decided to get them"
963,1.0,I bought two airpods from apple in the past and they both had lights that would come up showing how much battery life you had ON THE CASE
964,1.0, These do not have them
965,1.0," Also, I inspected my airpods and saw that my pair was USED"
966,1.0, Absolutely disgusting
967,1.0, BEWARE
968,1.0,Terrible experience compared to my old stolen ones
969,1.0,The Pairing experience super shoddy
970,1.0, And Syncing between the two earphones: a nightmare
971,1.0," 😓 frustrates me everytime, given how rarely it happened in my first gen pair"
972,1.0,I have to keep trying a few times before they finally decide to sync up 🙈 I wish they took a bit more care to get this working right
973,1.0," And it's definitely not work my piece, I tried 3 different earphones and asked a couple of my friends who had the same exact issue"
974,1.0,"And recently I'm having some signal cutoff issues when I walk with my phone in my pocket, I'm not sure why"
975,1.0,"I still love their form factor and are perfect for my use case, but it still needs improvement, which I beg of apple to make"
976,1.0,"Overall I bought airpods because they are the only ones that fit my ears, however even though the sound is good and they fit, the Bluetooth cuts in and out when you're walking and you can't have your device connected to them more than 15 feet away"
977,1.0," I can deal with most of the issues, but I really hate how the sound cuts in and out when I'm walking"
978,1.0," I would say if other earbuds fit your ears besides apple, get those because they'll be better than these"
979,1.0, I would go with taotronics which is what I had before and are honestly much better than these
980,1.0,UPDATE
981,1.0,"It's been four months since I got these and they are awful, I can't wear them while working out or walking around or doing anything besides sitting still in one spot because the audio goes in and out"
982,1.0, Don't waste your money on these
983,1.0,"So, the first set stopped working within a couple days"
984,1.0," The replacement set started having garbled sound in 4 months and after diagnosing it for 45 minutes with Apple Support, they said that would replace them for $150"
985,1.0,"98, even though they were under warranty and that's because they have limited warranty"
986,1.0, I asked for a supervisor
987,1.0," When I he came on the line, he went through all the same steps again and said that he would replace them for free"
988,1.0, What is happening with Apple
989,1.0," Anyway, it finally worked out, but I did have to give them my credit card to be charged until the old ones were received back, since they are sending the replacement in advance"
990,1.0, They can still decide not to accept the returned item
991,1.0," If they do, I will come back and update this"
992,5.0,I just love my Apple AirPods
993,5.0, This is the second set I’ve owned
994,5.0, My first set survived one falling into the dishwater (it still worked
995,5.0,"), one falling into the toilet (I know—eww"
996,5.0," But after fishing it out of a clean toilet with clean water and being disinfected—yes, it still worked"
997,5.0,") and one falling into a 425* oven—well, no that one did not survive"
998,5.0," Before I could decide if I wanted to risk third degree burns by attempting to rescue my precious AirPod, it slid down under the bottom plate of the oven and burst into flames within seconds"
999,5.0," So, here I am buying my second set, and for a great price"
1000,5.0," I am not a snob when it comes to sound quality (I had a $39 cheap knockoff that I was perfectly happy with, and I still use my wired ear buds from time to time) but after my husband bought me my first set of AirPods I realized how superior the sound is"
1001,5.0, Easy to pair up with Bluetooth devices and I have no problem wearing them for hours at a time
1002,5.0," My biggest problem is—you guessed it, they fall out sometimes—at the worst moments"
1003,5.0," Hubby’s told me he won’t buy me anymore if I have another “accident”, but we’ll see"
1004,5.0,Oh my gosh there was a short sale and my Hubby got these for me for Mother's Day and I could not be happier
1005,5.0,Pros:
1006,5.0,* NO WIRES (until you need to charge the case itself)
1007,5.0,"* These are the only in-ear headphones I can use, everything else gives me headaches after a short while"
1008,5.0,* They fit snug and very rarely fall out
1009,5.0,* Charges last half a day of continuous listening to music
1010,5.0,* Sound clarity is very good
1011,5.0," Callers can hear me better than from my phone by itself because of the case, and much better than my car's mic"
1012,5.0,"* Recharging is very short, less than 15 minutes to fully charge inside it's case - less than an hour and the case is good to recharge the ear pieces for a 2 day period without a wall socket"
1013,5.0,* Lightweight
1014,5.0,Cons:
1015,5.0,* White shows EVERYTHING
1016,5.0," Every spec of dust, every fragment of ear wax will show up from space"
1017,5.0,"* The charge on the ear pieces only seems to last 5-6 hours at most, maybe only 4 with non-stop listening at a higher volume"
1018,5.0,"* Sometimes the ear pieces lose battery and die even while not connected to anything, if not in their case"
1019,5.0,* Sometimes one earbud seems to lose charge before the other and I still am not sure why
1020,5.0, Stereo sound
1021,5.0,"* These do not cancel sound very well - I don't believe that is part of the design anyway, but worth mentioning that if you are trying to drown out noisy, gossiping co-workers, airplane humming, or highway tire rumbling, you'll want OVER EAR headphones"
1022,1.0,"After having these bad little MFs for less than one week, I suffered an unfortunate bout of being relieved of my very possession of said precious subjects"
1023,1.0," I was working with them in my pocket & they must've fallen out & when some bottomfeeder happened upon them, his day was made & mine was ruined"
1024,1.0," If there's a God in heaven, someone very near & dear to whoever discovered their unanticipated treasure today is suffering through the final hours of their soon-to-be-over life as I type out this review & then at least whatever pleasure they may have experienced ultimately at my expense via my lost electronics accessories will have thereby been deemed short-lived"
1025,1.0," As much as I shudder to think my actions would ever bring pain or sadness to the heart or life of another, the only greater fear I hold within the privacy of my own consciousness is that of ever learning that my absent mindedness had a role in someone's effortless victory or circumstancial good fortune all while netting zero benefit directly to myself"
1026,1.0, To neglect one's self in such a way would be akin to betraying my own mother as she loves me dearly
1027,1.0," In my eternal pledge to honor her without limitation or condition, protecting my self-interest is in effect a conscious act in treasuring her"
1028,1.0," Just for the sake of clarity, when it comes to my commitment to my mother as things pertain to honor & such, there is no task too great nor feat too challenging provided that the conditions are convenient & the terms favorably reasonable"
1029,1.0, My mother did hit me one time
1030,1.0,"we forgive, but we don't forget"
1031,1.0,let's not be foolish here
1032,1.0,Bought these for my 18 yr old sons birthday
1033,1.0, They worked 2 days then one side stopped working
1034,1.0, he tried trouble shooting them and nothing worked
1035,1.0, Now neither side work
1036,1.0, For the amount of money I paid for these as well as being an Apple product you would think they would be a great product
1037,1.0, NOPE
1038,1.0, these suck
1039,3.0,"We've been so tired of using clunky headphones or the terrible fall-out all the time earbuds Apple provides, that we thought we'd order the air pods"
1040,3.0,"We have lots of apple products - an iPad, a macbook pro, and a couple i phones"
1041,3.0,"We're not luddites, BUT we're not super computer savvy either - we don't program for instance"
1042,3.0,I was excited to give these a try
1043,3.0," If you can get them to work, the sound is beautiful and clear"
1044,3.0, It was relatively easy to pair the pods to the iPhones
1045,3.0," But, we still can't pair them to the iPad, and though we've had the ear pods for a week, we've only been able to pair them with the MacBook pro ONE time"
1046,3.0,They come in a small package like a dental floss container
1047,3.0," As it turns out, there is a teeny tiny button to press on the back of the container"
1048,3.0, It is well disguised
1049,3.0," They could have done something better so that your hand could FEEL the teeny tiny indent button, but I had to use a magnifying glass and strong light to discover it"
1050,3.0, They should paint it with a RED dot
1051,3.0," The only time I got the MacBook Pro to work, I had to get on my i phone and select the air pods there"
1052,3.0,"Some things to know: when you're trying to pair, make sure your ear pods are IN the case and that the case is well charged"
1053,3.0, Then open the case and press the invisible button
1054,3.0, Look inside the case and see if the inner tiny light has changed from green to flashing white
1055,3.0," If the case is flashing, place the case near the item you want to pair with"
1056,3.0, Make sure your iPhone is DE-selected and maybe your air pods will pair with your iPad or MacBook Pro
1057,3.0," Maybe,"
1058,3.0,Doesn't it seem like a big company like Apple could have made these more user friendly
1059,3.0,We tried about 10 U Tube videos trying to get these to work
1060,4.0,I like that it moves so smoothly between apple products
1061,4.0," I have a phone, macbook, and ipad"
1062,4.0,The mic worked out okay on zoom calls - likely to work well with facetime and other video phones
1063,4.0,"Neat features like being able to ping for location in where's my phone, and they will charge from the case"
1064,4.0,"But, the big huge downside is the battery life"
1065,4.0, I only get maybe two hours consecutively
1066,4.0," My cowin headphones get waaaay better battery mileage and even also have wonderful noise cancelling (airpods have no noise cancelling to speak of, though they have reasonably good sound quality for what they are), but the mic doesn't work well on cowins- it has distortion"
1067,4.0, So I tend to use these on the go or if I know I'll need to speak
1068,4.0, It will last for about one college class and that's what I needed
1069,4.0,I put off buying these because I thought they were over priced ear buds
1070,4.0, I ended up buying them after christmas because I was sick of going through cheaper headsets one after the other which were never meant for the kind of use I was putting them through with virtual school
1071,4.0, I guess whether they are overpriced or not is in the eye of the beholder
1072,4.0, I got great use out of them so I'm inclined to say they were worth the price
1073,4.0," However, I will also say that my daughter was really jealous of them and asked for her own pair"
1074,4.0," She is often on facetime calls with her best friend, so I told her she could buy a less expensive clone of this product off amazon or wait for me to save up"
1075,4.0, She opted for a half-priced off brand version and she is very happy with them
1076,4.0, The look of the off-brand ones is just the same
1077,4.0, I'm relieved I wasn't spendy on her set if what she got works well for her
1078,4.0," I would advise buyers to check around the market, and consider the use you have in mind for them to decide what would work best for your needs"
1079,4.0," Bluetooth earbuds are not a new technology, there are many options out there - don't feel like its apple or nothing"
1080,5.0,I didn't know if these were worth the money considering that these seemed like glorified regular earbuds
1081,5.0, I actually like these better
1082,5.0," While the price is high, it seems worth it in my couple months of owning them"
1083,5.0, I got these for my first semester at college to ignore people and listen to bomb ass music without looking too broke
1084,5.0," FIrst off, these are pretty good with noise canceling"
1085,5.0," I can hear people sometimes if the music is low enough, but the sound is more muffled"
1086,5.0," It is great when I want to pay attention to my work or ignore people as they tune out people and they also make it a universal sign of ""don't talk to me"" which is great when I don't want to talk to others in public"
1087,5.0, Even if I'm not listening to music
1088,5.0, The other great thing is the fact that it's quick to charge and the battery life is pretty good
1089,5.0,In comparison to regular earbuds or even headphones is the fact that they are easy to pack and easy to access
1090,5.0, Headphones are bulky and generally awkward (for me at least) to have around the neck
1091,5.0," However, airpods are really easy to put in and then when you are done using them, you put them back in the small compact case"
1092,5.0, Another is the lack of wire
1093,5.0," I don't know about you, but for me the lack of wire is much easier"
1094,5.0," When I am in the mood to listen to something with my earbuds, I no longer need to un-knot the earbuds but simply take them out of the case"
1095,5.0," So like I said, I really like these and enjoy the easy access and the small compactness of this as well as the increase in sound quality and battery life"
1096,5.0," If I could rate this out of 10, I would give it an honest 10"
1097,4.0,Buenas noches
1098,4.0,No me gustó que el paquete donde venían estaba abierto hablo de la caja de Amazon
1099,3.0,"I love the way they link instantly and the sound is great, but apparently I must have small ear openings, because even after repeated wearings and trying all kinds of angles, they are not secure, need frequent adjustment and fall out of my ears with little provocation"
1100,3.0," I am just walking around, not doing sports or anything strenuous"
1101,3.0," Now that I've had them in my ears, I don't think I can return them, but it was an expensive experiment"
1102,3.0," (I have $29 ones that fit better, and I thought I would upgrade, ha)"
1103,1.0,Called apple support to get airpods replaced or fixed under warranty
1104,1.0, The right one stopped working and nothing they recommended would fix the problem
1105,1.0, I called back a second time and was then informed that the item was out of warranty even though I just purchased them in October of this year
1106,1.0, Apple customer service then went to explain that my purchase date was irrelevant and what mattered was the date that they displayed in their system for a purchase between March and May
1107,1.0," Even if that was the case, it still should be covered under the one year warranty"
1108,1.0," So then that makes me think that someone else bought the ipods in march, returned them, then Amazon turned around and resold them to me as new"
1109,1.0, Don't buy apple products
1110,1.0, The support was rude and just by their demeanor I figured they were trying their best to get out of a legitimate warranty claim
1111,4.0,"Great device, but make sure it is fitting your ear correct or they will fall out"
1112,4.0," I haven't been able to narrow down exactly what it is, but every now and then one will fall out or slip to some crazy angle"
1113,4.0," I am super careful but it will get me sometime, I am near positive"
1114,4.0, I have seen it quite a few times on planes where people fall asleep and wake up to find their ear bud gone
1115,4.0, It happens
1116,4.0,"For being a tiny little device, they seem to do pretty well on holding power"
1117,4.0," To mitigate any real possible problems, I use the charging case whenever I can"
1118,4.0," Go to lunch, charge them for 1/2 hour"
1119,4.0," Driving home from work, charge in the truck for that time while charging the case as well"
1120,4.0,Sound seems to be pretty good
1121,4.0, I can jack my iPhone up quite a bit and not really hear any distortion
1122,4.0," I use these with a MPow Bluetooth adapter and I get distortion there, but I have proven it is the MPow"
1123,4.0,Rarely do I use the Airpods with my phone in a noisy condition so i don't have much to say about noise cancellation
1124,4.0," I also rarely use the touch features minus the ""oops I just turned them off again"" accidental"
1125,4.0,One thing that is a bit annoying is in regard to the charging case
1126,4.0, I work in an industrial environment
1127,4.0," Somehow, that case tends to find every single metal shaving known to man"
1128,4.0, Getting it away from the magnetic pull of the case can be a real pain in the butt
1129,4.0, I use a tiny plastic screw driver to lightly scrap it away so I don't dig into the plastic
1130,4.0," Depending on how much you have there, This can be tedious to get out"
1131,2.0,I am unsure who ears Apple had in mind when creating these ear buds
1132,2.0," I like to think I have average, regular ears but these headphones make me feel like perhaps my ears are too small"
1133,2.0, I have to adjust the ear piece every few seconds so much so I had to buy one of the ear attachment pieces sold here on Amazon just so the headphones don't fall out which coincidentally has happened
1134,2.0, Watching my $160+ Airpods fall to the ground nearly broke my heart
1135,2.0, Aside from that the sound quality is fine
1136,2.0, I can feel the bass
1137,2.0," I hate the fact that there's a button now instead of the tap, tap feature the Air Pod Second generation has"
1138,2.0," So I have to deal with the ear piece constantly trying to fall out, being shorter than the Sec Gen and now I have work to find this miniature button on the ear piece just to skip songs"
1139,2.0, Listen to me sounding spoiled
1140,2.0, I'm at a cross
1141,2.0," I was ""forced"" to buy these because my 2nd Gen was staticky and everyone complained"
1142,2.0, I thought perhaps these being the newer gen they'd be greater
1143,2.0, Oh well
1144,2.0, At least people can hear me now
1145,1.0,Update: I've had these for six months and the case has stopped charging
1146,1.0, They are essentially useless now
1147,1.0, I would recommend purchasing through Apple so you can get another pair if yours malfunctions
1148,1.0," Since I purchased on here and the return window is closed, I cannot get another pair, which means $130 down the drain"
1149,1.0,This was definitely one of my best Amazon purchases
1150,1.0, The sound quality on these is amazing even during phone calls
1151,1.0," The charging case holds an impressive amount of charge so I only need to recharge it once every 2-3 days, which isn't very much considering I use these 8-10 hours a day"
1152,1.0,at work
1153,1.0," That being said, there are some cons to these"
1154,1.0, The battery life of the AirPods themselves isn't the best-- you'll get 1-2 hours max
1155,1.0," Now, five minutes in the charging case will get these back to full charge, so take that with a grain of salt"
1156,1.0, The biggest con for me has been the Bluetooth connectivity
1157,1.0, I have an IPhone 11 so I would expect these to have no issues with connecting
1158,1.0," However, every few times I use these, one or both of the AirPods does not connect when I pull it out of the case"
1159,1.0, It usually takes about five minutes to figure out the problem and re-connect them
1160,1.0, It's definitely a problem when I'm trying to pick up a call on my AirPods or listen to something quickly
1161,1.0," For that reason, I'd give these 4/5 stars"
1162,1.0, They're still worth the purchase but I'd recommend adding AppleCare so you can get a replacement if you have the same issues
1163,1.0, (P
1164,1.0,S
1165,1.0," If you have an Apple watch, these do not connect independently to the Apple Watch, you will need to have your IPhone on you"
1166,1.0,)
1167,1.0,My wife purchased these for me as a gift in August 2020 and they worked great up until about a month ago
1168,1.0," At that time, the right ear bud microphone began to fail and would no longer detect sound unless I was yelling"
1169,1.0, I contacted customer support at Apple and worked through all of the potential resolutions such as updating to the newest iOS (14
1170,1.0,6) and confirming that the AirPods were running the most recent firmware
1171,1.0, When customer support was not able to resolve the issue they suggested that I send the AirPods in for repair
1172,1.0, I received a shipping box and label for FedEx and sent them offer for repair
1173,1.0, The AirPods arrived back at my home about 3 days later with a note from the technicians stating that there was nothing wrong with them
1174,1.0," I then tested them again on my phone and my wife's phone, and with both phones the right microphone would only detect sound at a loud volume (i"
1175,1.0,e
1176,1.0, yelling) and yet still garbled
1177,1.0, Again I contacted customer support at Apple
1178,1.0, This time the agent suggested that the next step would be to take the AirPods to the nearest Apple Store so that I could demonstrate the issue for a technician there
1179,1.0, Unfortunately the nearest Apple Store is 2
1180,1.0,"5 hours from my home, though this did not seem to be an inconvenience in the eyes of the agent"
1181,1.0," At this point, I stated that it did not make sense to drive 5 hours round-trip to repair a $130 device, and I questioned why I could not send them back for repair while identifying the exact issue"
1182,1.0," The agent agreed to send another shipping box and to include on the repair ""ticket"" that the issue was with the right microphone"
1183,1.0, So
1184,1.0, (can you guess where this is going
1185,1.0,") I received another box, sent the AirPods a 2nd time for repair, and waited"
1186,1.0," Again, they returned them to me and stated that nothing was wrong with them"
1187,1.0," And again, the right microphone still does not function correctly"
1188,1.0," At this point I am left wondering why the ""World's Most Valuable Company"" would find it acceptable to ask a customer to take 5 hours of his/her time to fix Apple's product, instead of simply sending a replacement pair and keeping the customer happy"
1189,1.0, Apple's product support has ruined what could be a great product
1190,3.0,I bought the 2nd Generation Airpods through Amazon on launch day
1191,3.0," In less than a month, the right earbud stopped working"
1192,3.0, I tried following all the guides and syncing/resyncing but ended up getting a replacement at the Apple store
1193,3.0," Considering the price of these, I'm disappointed that they failed so soon"
1194,3.0," Apparently, this is an issue with many Airpods"
1195,1.0,"I found you on Amazon Prime Day, waiting In the Warehouse Deals; you said you were ""Very Good"" and looking for a new beginning, but I now realize it was all lies because inside, you were a mess"
1196,1.0, I tried to listen to you with enthusiasm and joy but know now you were just a toy
1197,1.0," After a few minutes or so, I sensed the ""disconnect"" between us as you would just shut down for no apparent reason, but I now know you came into my life with issues that were never disclosed"
1198,1.0," However, it was likely never to be, as we were not a suitable ""fit"" from the moment we encountered"
1199,1.0," For one, I never felt ""comfortable"" with you, or did I appreciate you just ""falling out"" on me when I needed you to stay"
1200,1.0," Looking back, it appears all we did was waste each other's time, but I have to say life is genuinely better now since I got you packed and dropped off at Kohl's"
1201,1.0," I can only hope that you will make someone else happy and proud one day, but unfortunately, I only see pain, frustration, disappointment, and anger for anyone who gets involved with you"
1202,1.0," Therefore, let's not forget honesty remains the best policy, and deception can never be the answer to unloading one's problems"
1203,5.0,These bevies are the right thing to do
1204,5.0, I have tried so many other and wasted my money
1205,5.0, The noise cancellation when worn with the mike down is not as strong as when worn upside down
1206,5.0," Try them, it is a new experience"
1207,5.0," I wore my wired pods upside down for the same reason, they seal your ear canal to the outside noise and don’t hurt your ears"
1208,5.0," Of course every one is anatomically different, but it is my experience"
1209,5.0, Great product
1210,5.0," A little expensive in price, but worth every penny"
1211,5.0," The sound is amazing, they did not look like they have the quality of sound, but they do"
1212,1.0,"I had mine for a week and the left earbud stopped working, no problem I deleted then connected and paired again"
1213,1.0," Still not working, charged them fully, still nothing"
1214,1.0, At that point the left earbud was giving an error that wasn't readable
1215,1.0, I returned them for a replacement
1216,1.0, I now have the replacement and I'm returning them today due to the fact that the original ones broke after a week
1217,1.0, I really don't want to have to deal with this again
1218,1.0, LG around the neck bluetooth earphones work the best imo which is what I had before these
1219,1.0, Plus the airpod design hurts my ears and they tend to fall out alot
1220,2.0,"If you still have a headphone jack in your phone, don't buy these"
1221,2.0, After buying several dysfunctional dongles with headphone jacks (both official apple brand and off brand) and off brand wireless earbuds worth over $100 combined I gave in and bought these
1222,2.0," In general these are better than most wireless earbuds, and its better to just buy these despite the price"
1223,2.0," They are about as comfortable to wear, and they have about the same level sound quality as my $10 gummy earbuds (Gummy earbuds have good quality and last a while so I'm not saying the quality is bad, just that these are insanely overpriced)"
1224,2.0, They have some convenient functions but they are not worth $150 if you can avoid it
1225,2.0, I enjoy being able to listen to music and podcasts privately so for the sake of continuing that source of pleasure I was forced to buy these
1226,2.0," They don't always instantly connect to your phone which is slightly inconvenient but an easy fix, and the tap to pause function only sometimes works, so I could either tap it twice and it instantly pause perfectly like its supposed to or it could fail to pause after a dozen attempts"
1227,2.0, My next phone purchase might just be going backwards to the last iphone with a headphone jack just so I can listen to my music hassle free
1228,2.0, That or finally abandon apple after all these years and find a good brand with a headphone jack
1229,2.0,"I've been using some cheaper options, but decided to upgrade to the real deal"
1230,2.0, I've seen people using these in TV interviews and figured they must be the best
1231,2.0,"Unfortunately, for my uses, which are mostly recorded video interviews via Zoom, etc"
1232,2.0,", the microphone was awful"
1233,2.0," Versus a cheapo $30 lav mic, the mic on the buds sounded very muffled"
1234,2.0, No crispness on the high frequencies at all
1235,2.0," Worst of all, people could not hear me on the other end"
1236,2.0, The output volume for the mic was extremely low versus everything else I've used
1237,2.0," I tried adjusting the audio settings in Zoom and other programs, but still no good even at 100% volume"
1238,2.0,"Maybe it sounds great when used with iPhone or an Apple device (I don't know), but performance when paired with my Windows 10 laptop was too poor for my uses"
1239,2.0," It paired fine and I could hear fine but the muffled, low-volume microphone was a deal breaker for me"
1240,1.0,"As I lost my previous pair of EarPods (MMEF2AM/A, ordered in Jul-2018) in the plane, it was an easy choice to purchase a new pair, as I was very happy with my previous version"
1241,1.0," So, I purchased a new pair early Oct-2019"
1242,1.0," However, after using the Apple EarPods for almost 2 months, I notice that I am so very disappointed with the quality of the newer model, that I decided to write a review"
1243,1.0,Notes:
1244,1.0,"-Although I am unhappy with the product itself and not with Amazon, the Amazon Helpdesk advised me to leave a Product Review"
1245,1.0,"-I could find that my previous version is the MMEF2AM/A, while I cannot find a version number with the latest purchase"
1246,1.0," The Order title was ""latest model"", so I assume this is a different model"
1247,1.0,-I never dropped or damaged my EarPods and I use a protective cover over the charger case
1248,1.0,"-WIth regards to my third point below: I generally put the ears back in the charger case, but occasionally (perhaps once every 50 times I use the ears) put the ears in my side pocket)"
1249,1.0,Main differences with the old version:
1250,1.0,-It sometimes takes much longer for the ears to connect to my phone (which is the same phone that I used with my previous version)
1251,1.0," I'd say that 1 out of 10 times I put the ears in, the connection takes about 10 seconds"
1252,1.0," As I use my EarPods for work-calls, I sometimes miss calls while waiting for the ears to connect"
1253,1.0, The old EarPods always connected quickly and without problems
1254,1.0,"-If I put the left ear in earlier than the right ear, the right ear sometimes does not connect (while it is fully charge)"
1255,1.0," I can take the ears out and put them back in, but this doesn't help"
1256,1.0," The only way to ""reset"" the ears, is to put the ears back into the charger case, before I put them in my ears"
1257,1.0, This never happened with the older version
1258,1.0,"-If I don't put the ears back in the charger case but put them in a pocket, my phone somehow still thinks the ears are connected (probably because they don't move much relatively from each other), which drains both my ears AND my phone"
1259,1.0, The previous version did not give me this issue whatsoever
1260,1.0,"-Possibly partly because of the above point, but also in general (at least to my feeling), the ears battery life is much lower"
1261,1.0," The charger case has no problems, but I honestly have the feeling that my new ears have about half the life of the previous version"
1262,1.0,"Asides of the above, the EarPods work well and have high quality sound, hence I suspect that the item itself is not broken in any way"
1263,1.0," Instead, I suspect design and/or software flaws"
1264,1.0,"I am very disappointed with this, as none of the above issues ever occurred with my previous version"
1265,1.0," Initially, I hoped it was both a one-time thing (which it wasn't) and that the flaws came with being ""a newer version"" and were possibly fixable by software updates, but after using the ears for almost 2 months and seeing the issues reoccur, I wanted to give back this feedback"
1266,5.0,I received authentic Apple AirPods and I even received them a day earlier than expected
1267,5.0," These are definitely an upgrade from my original Gen 1 AirPods that I purchased back in 2018, thankfully"
1268,5.0," Once again, pairing to my phone is phenomenal and the battery life is long"
1269,5.0," Of course my old pair wore down over time but I believe, I’ve gotten good use out of them and I’m confident this pair will last just as long"
1270,5.0," I like the hey Siri feature and that I can even control the volume with Siri now, very cool"
1271,5.0," Sound quality is just as good as always, overall I’m satisfied"
1272,5.0," Oh, and one more thing "
1273,5.0," These things attract dirt and dust like a magnet and scratch very easily, therefore I highly recommend a case or some form of protection for them"
1274,1.0,BUYER BEWARE
1275,1.0," I ordered these Apple AirPods, which are sold by Amazon and not a third party"
1276,1.0, They arrived in perfect condition and sealed box
1277,1.0," However, I called Apple Customer Support and spoke with an Apple representative to confirm they were true Apple and not fake"
1278,1.0," In order to confirm this I asked about the serial number on the box, then compared to the serial number on the charging case, right earbud, and left earbud"
1279,1.0, They have three different serial numbers
1280,1.0," That confirms the suspicion, these are not a matched set"
1281,1.0, They have been tampered with and then resealed to make it look like a new product
1282,1.0," At best these are used, seconds, or refurbished and mismatched when putting the set together"
1283,1.0, I am returning
1284,1.0,don't pay this price for refurbished
1285,1.0, Also notice the description does not disclose this
1286,1.0, This is fraud
1287,5.0,"These are the Apple Airpods Gen-2, not wireless charging, and not the Pro (I hate the round rubber tips that everyone seems to love)"
1288,5.0," First of all, these are very easy to use"
1289,5.0, The sound is fantastic
1290,5.0, I suppose I am an audiophile since I love music
1291,5.0," the sound is clear, balanced, and the bass is very present"
1292,5.0," The advantage is that the design of these airpods does not require you to jam rubber tips in your ears, and the quality of the sound is therefore dependent on the tips staying in place; which, most of the time they do not"
1293,5.0," If I have to keep reaching up to readjust the buds for a better sound, what happened to the hands-free experience"
1294,5.0," Also, I am not sure what some people do to get the Apple Airpods Gen-2 to fall out of their ears"
1295,5.0, I have literally tried to accomplish that and unless you go full-on metal head mode I don't think you can do it
1296,5.0," So, let me make it easy for you, and do take my word"
1297,5.0," I have read reviews by people who were using, and listening to God knows what"
1298,5.0," Pros:Great sound, easy to use, nice size case"
1299,5.0," some tws earbuds have those cases that are so huge, YEESH"
1300,5.0," Also, very secure and comfortable fit"
1301,5.0, Cons: the Voice Memos app on the iPhone is affected
1302,5.0, when you record with those on you will get a sound as though you were on the other side of a phone line and not in the same room
1303,5.0," They are great for working out and listening to your music, podcasts, etc, also, only one gesture per earbud"
1304,5.0, I found the Ticpods and will try them today
1305,5.0, They have the same Apple design
1306,5.0, no crazy rubber tips
1307,5.0," You get a lot more gestures, and if the sound is like that of Apple I will be returning my Apple airpods"
1308,5.0," Update, the sound of those pods was not in anyway bad, the fit was ok, slightly too large, and I prefer the opened balanced Apple sound"
1309,5.0," The tick pods gave me more of the Bose sound, it’s not as opened, it’s more compressed"
1310,5.0, Last
1311,5.0, I don't care about noise cancelation
1312,5.0, unless I am on a plane; and even then
1313,5.0, I hate to purposefully deprive myself of one of my so important senses; it intuitively feels like a really bad idea
1314,5.0, Here is an update A few months later: The Apple AirPods are simply a wonderful product
1315,5.0, I know they’re pricey but they’re that good
1316,5.0," The sound, the fit, the look, great"
1317,5.0,I purchased these as a gift for my wife
1318,5.0," At first, she wasn't sure if she would use them but they quickly became her favorite accessory"
1319,5.0, She uses them when watching TV on her phone and needs to walk away for a moment with no need to carry her phone with her; she hooks them up to our Apple TV and can freely move around without having to lug anything else around
1320,5.0, She connects to her work laptop and uses them when grading her students' multimedia projects
1321,5.0," They fit her well (I have a pair as well and they are quite comfortable), they have outstanding battery life (she's not one to remember to charge accessories, but these last weeks without a need for a charge), and they just work"
1322,5.0, Who has time to fiddle with bluetooth connections and such
1323,5.0, Highly recommended
1324,2.0,"I like these AirPods, but they have some serious downsides in my mind, that are quite frustrating"
1325,2.0," What I like: the sound quality, when they are working properly, is very good"
1326,2.0," They fit well in my ears and feel secure, and the battery charge is pretty impressive (I only charge the case occasionally, and it keeps the earbuds charged for as long as I need them)"
1327,2.0," The audio quality for phone calls is good, and it's nice to be able to talk on the phone hands-free"
1328,2.0," There is virtually no noise cancellation, but I didn't buy them for that purpose"
1329,2.0," I wanted comfortable, easy to use, high-quality wireless earbuds"
1330,2.0,What I don't like: I have an Android phone and have had consistent issues with the bluetooth connection
1331,2.0," In fact, I returned my first pair of AirPods and exchanged them for a new pair because of this"
1332,2.0," Sometimes (especially when I'm walking outside) the bluetooth connection will cut out, then reconnect"
1333,2.0, It usually does this several times
1334,2.0," When the signal reconnects the audio sounds echo-y, like one earbud is lagging slightly behind the other"
1335,2.0, It disrupts the sound quality and is really annoying
1336,2.0," This only happens when I'm out walking, and usually only in certain places, so I wonder if it's an issue with signal interference"
1337,2.0, I don't have this problem when connected to my MacBook or my phone when I'm listening to music indoors or while I'm driving
1338,2.0," These are advertised as working with Android phones, so I'm very disappointed with the issues I'm having"
1339,2.0, My replacement pair has the exact same problems
1340,2.0,If these issues continue to be disruptive I will have to return these as well
1341,2.0, It's very frustrating to have my music cut out and the poor audio quality
1342,2.0," I'm hoping that the audio issues are signal interference from specific locations and that they'll work in other locations, because I really do like having the wireless earbuds for music and calls"
1343,2.0," I'm hopeful, and would appreciate any fixes others have tried, but I'll have to return them if this continues to be an issue"
1344,5.0,"The title of this review kind of says it all--these AirPods are amazing for everyday things like phone calls, listening to music while travelling, and other low-impact activities"
1345,5.0," The sound is really great, linking them to my iPhone was super easy, and the battery life is really good"
1346,5.0," If you're looking to ditch the corded headphones and you're someone on the go, this is a fantastic purchase"
1347,5.0,"All that said, I originally bought them because I was looking to hit the gym pretty darn hard to get rid of some of my Covid padding"
1348,5.0," When I work out, I get really sweaty (ya girl is working HARD), so I find that halfway through my workout, they don't always stay in my ears very well"
1349,5.0," I make it work, but there are some points where the ear piece feels like it's going to come flying out of my ear if I don't stop and adjust"
1350,5.0,"I'm still going to give these 5 stars because they are pretty awesome, and I use them for so many other thinks outside of working out, but if you're looking for some AirPods to use while working out and you're a sweaty Betty, I'd look to get ones that are built with a bit more of a sports mode"
1351,5.0,"There are much better reviews to read, but I wanted to clear something up"
1352,5.0," First, I’m not an audiophile and mostly am using these to listen to books as I do other things"
1353,5.0," However, they are much easier to use than other wireless earbuds I have bought before; just pair once and they remain paired"
1354,5.0," Take one out if somebody is talking to you, put it back in and it starts up in the same place"
1355,5.0, Battery is long lasting and just a few minutes of top off can get you more hours
1356,5.0," You can hear background noises of course, so you don’t feel isolated"
1357,5.0, I really can’t speak to noise cancellation so I gave it a three star review but others are more knowledgeable
1358,5.0,"The one thing I wanted to clear up-these earbuds are 2nd gen, but maybe the case is 1st gen"
1359,5.0, I think that is confusing some people
1360,5.0," The charging light is inside and it’s wired to charge, but when you look under settings you can see the actual earbuds are 2nd gen"
1361,5.0,Mine were new and definitely from Apple
1362,5.0," Oh, and I have small ears and normally find earbuds painful but I’ve been wearing these for two days without issues"
1363,5.0, My only problem is that I have very long hair and if I sweep it back I sometimes knock one out
1364,5.0, When I’m home it’s normally in a ponytail so no big problem
1365,5.0, I may get something to keep them around my neck when I use them outside of the house and it’s something long-haired men and women might need to think about
1366,5.0,I didn’t realize how annoying having tangled wires for earbuds was
1367,5.0," I should have gotten two pair, one for home and one for out"
1368,5.0," Oh well, next Prime Day"
1369,5.0,I was a little skeptical about buying apple products from amazon because I wasn't sure if it was going to be legit
1370,5.0, But I was definitely proved wrong
1371,5.0," I was originally going to purchase my AirPods through apple but to be honest, I found a cheaper price through Amazon"
1372,5.0, So I decided instead of paying $159+$29 (apple care+) + $15
1373,5.0,04 (tax to ship to my location) Equaling it all out to $203
1374,5.0,04
1375,5.0, I decided to buy the AirPods from Apple's store via Amazon for a total of $136
1376,5.0,72 ( $128
1377,5.0,98+ $7
1378,5.0,74 (TAX)
1379,5.0, I also purchased AppleCare + for Headphones ( 2 Years ) Protection(A Must Have whenever buying anything Apple
1380,5.0, It will save you a lot of money and heartache if something goes wrong
1381,5.0,) for $31
1382,5.0,32 ($29
1383,5.0,00 + $2
1384,5.0,32 (TAX)
1385,5.0, So the total price of everything would have been $168
1386,5.0,04 ; But I had 2 gift cards (one for $18
1387,5.0,68 and one for $136
1388,5.0,72) which knocked the prices of the AppleCare insurance down to $12
1389,5.0,64 and the AirPods down to $0
1390,5.0,00
1391,5.0, The great thing about being an Amazon Prime Member is most of the time you don't have to pay for shipping
1392,5.0," I read the reviews for these AirPods and a lot of people were saying to make sure it says ""PRIME"" before you buy and that was definitely worth it"
1393,5.0, I've always wanted a pair of AirPods ever since they came out but I didn't want to rush to buy them when my other apple headphones that came with my iPhone 7 Plus (that I've had since 2018 with no problems) were working just fine
1394,5.0," Of course with any pair of wired headphones, there is always the wires getting tangled"
1395,5.0, But luckily with AirPods you don't have that issue
1396,5.0, I wouldn't say I'm cheap but when it comes to products that are of excellent quality and are built to last like Apple; It is definitely worth spending a good amount of cash for them
1397,5.0," So all in all, I save a ton of money and my AirPods work like a dream"
1398,5.0, I Love My New Toy
1399,1.0,I feel very disappointed that I am one of the very few on the planet that don’t just love these EarPods
1400,1.0, I can’t have them in my ear more than 10 minutes otherwise they begin to create lots of pressure in the inner part of my ear Cartlidge starts to throb and hurt very badly
1401,1.0, Not wanting to give up on them I purchased rubber padding for the earpiece but it’s basically pointless to have those covers on the earbud if you’re planning on taking them out and putting them in the charger
1402,1.0, Because then you have to takeoff the cover store those without losing them and put them back in there for the charge for me it’s too much and I just want to head and had to return them
1403,1.0, Looks like it’s just the old fashion for me until Apple comes out with something that has more comfort
1404,1.0,Please note that this review is not for the quality of the product
1405,1.0,"I just received my air pods, which I was really excited to get"
1406,1.0, When I opened it I immediately thought something was off because the box was not sealed
1407,1.0," I did read some reviews about getting used products, but I figured that wouldn't happen"
1408,1.0, It's never happened before
1409,1.0," When I opened them, I could see they are so obviously used and gross"
1410,1.0, I almost could not believe my eyes
1411,1.0, The fact that this could be sent to someone is just crazy
1412,1.0," I am returning and buying somewhere else, like I should have in the first place"
1413,3.0,On the whole I really like my Apple AirPods with one exception
1414,3.0," However, it’s an important one"
1415,3.0, The Bluetooth connection is sometimes unreliable
1416,3.0, Most of the time it works well sensing which device I’m using and transferring seamlessly between devices
1417,3.0," But, last night I finished listening to a Podcast on my phone, turned off the phone and got my iPad to catch up on some other items"
1418,3.0, There was no way I could get the AirPods to recognize my iPad
1419,3.0, Very frustrating
1420,3.0, This has happened several times
1421,1.0,Decided to see what the hype was all about and bought Airpods
1422,1.0," While they are admittedly aesthetically pleasing and pair nicely with Apple products, I just don't see what the hype is about"
1423,1.0," They're incredibly uncomfortable and fall out of my ears whenever I walk or laugh (and yes, I have tried orienting them differently in my ears to no avail)"
1424,1.0," If they're not falling out, they feel incredibly loose and like they are about to fall out"
1425,1.0," I looked online to see if other people were experiencing this and how to fix it, and found some articles about how airpod covers are available to allow the earbuds to stay in place"
1426,1.0," For the price I'm paying for these earbuds, why do I need to buy another $13-20 product to make the $135 product actually possible to wear"
1427,1.0, Absolutely ridiculous
1428,1.0, Why should anyone have to exert additional effort to actually make the product functional
1429,1.0," After messing around with the Airpods, I finally gave up and put on my ($10 ) earbuds that have the same sound quality and infinite more comfort than Airpods"
1430,1.0, I really do believe that Apple is the only company on this planet that can get away with its product being designed so poorly that methods to make their product wearable have to be created
1431,1.0,I also noticed that switching the Airpods from my Macbook Air to my iPhone XR was a hassle
1432,1.0, I would have to tap the option to forget my Airpods on my iPhone and then reconnect them after using them with my Macbook Air
1433,1.0,"Finally, I know people who swear by these earbuds"
1434,1.0," They work well with other Apple products and look good on the wearer, but I don't think that these reasons justify the price tag or all the other cons I've listed above"
1435,5.0,I LOVE THESE
1436,5.0," I have been wanting to go wireless for running, and my partner and I wanted to each wear one of the set as we ran together"
1437,5.0," He was paranoid that these would fall out, so we tried two other types first (jaybird Runs - JUNK in every way, and Apple beats - way too quiet and hurt my ears)"
1438,5.0," I finally convinced him to give these a shot, and they have been amazing"
1439,5.0," They do not budge at all when we run, the sound quality is impeccable, and they are soooo comfortable"
1440,5.0," The connectivity is somewhat less strong than the Beats, but plenty enough for our use"
1441,5.0," A few people mentioned about the microphone quality being subpar, but I have to disagree"
1442,5.0," I used them today during a conference call for work, while I was walking on the treadmill, and I came through loud and clear without background noise"
1443,5.0, So happy with this purchase - wish I had done it sooner
1444,1.0,Do not waste your money on buying these
1445,1.0," They are passive, which means you hear everything around you so no matter how high you turn up the volume, you'll be able to hear everything around you"
1446,1.0,The microphone is TERRIBLE
1447,1.0, On video call meetings I get complaints that the audio is fuzzy when I talk and that I sound like a robot
1448,1.0," Keep in mind these are paired to a brand new 2019 Apple MacBook Pro, so there should be no issues, yet there are"
1449,1.0, If these can't work with a product that the SAME manufacturer produces I can only imagine how bad they are if you're on PC
1450,1.0,"Battery life is also horrible, they die within a few hours of being charged and they get you with the gimmick that the case extends the battery life to over a day or something"
1451,1.0, Dont fall for this marketing ploy
1452,1.0, Sad waste of ~$150
1453,1.0, Wish I had bought something else
1454,1.0,I received the AirPods today and they paired to my phone as expected
1455,1.0, I used them for about 30 minutes and then charged them (they still had a charge of about 60%)
1456,1.0, I opened the case next to my iPhone and the phone showed them connected and fully charged
1457,1.0, I then took out the AirPods and placed them in my ears and started an audiobook
1458,1.0, The sound came through the speakers in my phone and the AirPods weren't working
1459,1.0, I opened settings on my phone and did everything I could find online to pair them after unpairing as the phone required me to do because it couldn't connect
1460,1.0," I went to ""get product support"" on the order page and spoke with customer service who walked me through the same steps I already took to try and pair the AirPods"
1461,1.0, I could not get them to pair
1462,1.0, My wife's AirPods paired fine with my phone so I ruled out a problem with my phone
1463,1.0," Amazon customer service connected me with Apple customer service and they are replacing the AirPods, however, I have a $215 credit authorization on my credit card pending their reception of the defective AirPods which must not be damaged"
1464,1.0, I don't think this is the norm for Apple products but sometimes you get a bad product
1465,1.0, I think Amazon should have sent me a new Pair with case and taken the defective ones as any local store would have done
1466,1.0, Amazon shouldn't have referred me to Apple for replacement
1467,1.0," The lesson I learned is that you don't ever click on ""get product support"" but you do click on ""return and replace"""
1468,3.0,"I'm fully in the Apple Ecosystem: iPhone, iPad, Mac"
1469,3.0," It was time to replace my wireless headphones and heard so much about the Airpods and so many friends love them, decided to stay Apple"
1470,3.0, Indeed Airpods work great with Apple products
1471,3.0," If that's all you're going to use them for, don't hesitate"
1472,3.0, I've bought and returned 3 other airbud products
1473,3.0," Primary issue was the device staying in the ear, then sound quality"
1474,3.0, Airpods stay in your ears and the sound is very good for the price point
1475,3.0,HOWEVER
1476,3.0,I'm primarily interested in wireless help with hearing especially my TVs
1477,3.0, I do not have Apple TV
1478,3.0, One TV is a smart Samsung with Bluetooth and the other is Panasonic that I've added a Bluetooth transmitter
1479,3.0, Anything that's not Apple has no issue pairing with the TVs
1480,3.0," When it comes to pairing the Airpods, my blood pressure rises each time"
1481,3.0," Sometimes they pair, sometimes not"
1482,3.0, But that's not the real issue
1483,3.0, The Airpods do not have independent sound control
1484,3.0," If you're using an Apple device, you control the sound through the device like phone, watch etc"
1485,3.0," However, my TVs (two major brands) do not have volume control for output"
1486,3.0, Very few TVs do
1487,3.0," So if the volume is too high or too low, I need to disconnect from the TV, pair with an Apple device, get the volume where I think I want it, then disconnect, then re-pair with the TV and hope the volume is somewhere near where I like it"
1488,3.0,I spoke with Apple about this and their response is buy an Apple TV device
1489,3.0, That way the Airpod will pair and sound can be controlled
1490,3.0," In my case, I would need to buy 2 Apple TV devices"
1491,3.0," The low priced airbuds come with volume control, apparently there isn't any technology magic required"
1492,3.0, Apple is choosing to not include
1493,3.0,I'm still undecided about returning the Airpods
1494,3.0," The fit, comfort and sound are well worth the price"
1495,3.0, The volume annoyance is a reminder each time I use these things that Apple is not the customer focused/design company we think they are
1496,3.0," Before I bought the Airpods, I spoke with 3 friends who use and highly recommend"
1497,3.0, Each one told me I would be able to control the volume with my iPhone or iPad
1498,3.0," After talking with Apple, that is not the case"
1499,3.0,"While on that subject, since my last Apple purchase this is the first time in about 18 months that I've needed to talk with Apple support"
1500,3.0, What has happened over there
1501,3.0, Four calls in two weeks; each time I feel like I'm speaking with someone that is just reading a script and doesn't really understand the issue
1502,3.0," The solution to most any issue seems to be, buy something else Apple"
1503,3.0," As a long time shareholder who's gone through a lot of stock splits, I appreciate the focus on Apple products but come on, there's more solutions to improving an Apple product than buying another Apple product"
1504,5.0,Very great product
1505,5.0," I have been using it only for one day but dang the quality is amazing, but these are not too different from the gen1 AirPods"
1506,5.0," If you have the money I recommend getting these l, you will not regret"
1507,1.0,"When I first bought this I was super excited, when the package showed up, there was NOTHING in my box, I contacted Amazon and Apple right away"
1508,1.0," Amazon was willing to send me a replacement, which was really nice"
1509,1.0," THEN, when I got that package, the AirPods didn't work"
1510,1.0," I let it charged for over two days before using, I tried setting it up on my iPhone XR which literally took over 30 mins for it to sync, THEN when it finally synced I couldn't hear out of the left AirPod, so then I unsynced it and had to go through the whole 30 min process again, and then I decided to get it another day with charging, and then they both worked for about 2 seconds and then it started to get static and the right one stopped working"
1511,1.0," Now, I have to send my product BACK to Apple for them to repair it"
1512,1.0," Honestly, save your time and either buy it at a big store"
1513,1.0, Don't buy through Amazon
1514,3.0,I bought these so I could listen to music while out on walks with my dog and Zoom calls
1515,3.0," After using them for a few months, I have some thoughts on this"
1516,3.0, I have a pair of over the head headphones that are noise cancelling
1517,3.0, They were cheap relative to the air pods and they deliver great sounds when I play music on them
1518,3.0, The airpods were only okay at 3x the price of the headphone
1519,3.0," They don't fall out of my ear while walking or jogging as some people have reported, but if I go to tuck my hair behind my ear or rest my head on something, they fall out because of the long tail it has on them"
1520,3.0, The AirPod pro looks like it would sit better in your ear and not get easily knocked out since it has a much shorter tail
1521,3.0," All that said, I tried cheaper blue tooth ear pods and they were terrible and kept disconnecting from my phone so I gave this 3 stars because the sound is good enough for walks and stays connected to the bluetooth"
1522,3.0, The battery life for using it for calls is pretty short (around 2 hours) but I've never run the battery out on them listening to music
1523,3.0, The wireless charging case recharges them very fast and I consider that a huge plus
1524,3.0, The AirPod pro is likely much better but I'd still buy these over the AirPod 2 just because of the huge price difference
1525,4.0,"These aren’t exactly “latest model,” using my definition of those words, or my 13 year old daughter’s definition"
1526,4.0, My daughter specifically requested the most up-to-date generation 2 AirPods on her Christmas wishlist
1527,4.0," Shopping in a hurry, I saw “latest model” and a reference to 2nd generation and bought these for her"
1528,4.0, The actual AirPods themselves are gen 2
1529,4.0, They do have a model number with a “2” in the second digit
1530,4.0," However, THEY DO NOT HAVE THE EXPECTED WIRELESS CHARGING CASE"
1531,4.0," This is basically a gen 2 AirPod, in a gen 1 case"
1532,4.0," If you do a browser search on how to identity gen 1 from gen 2, you’ll quickly find an Apple support webpage listing the methods for identification"
1533,4.0," The case is one of those methods, along with model number etc"
1534,4.0, This explains why my daughter expected the “latest model” would include the wireless case
1535,4.0, This feels like an intentional bait and switch by Apple
1536,4.0, I do not think any of this is Amazon’s fault
1537,4.0, I ordered a pair for my son online from a National Retailer
1538,4.0, That one also said “latest model” and the same thing happened
1539,4.0," So, if you are buying these for someone who specifically requested gen 2, don’t get this one"
1540,4.0, Read carefully and get the one that specifically mentions the wireless charging case
1541,4.0," At this point my daughter is so disappointed with her gift, I am going to have to buy the wireless case separately, which in the end, is going to cost way more"
1542,4.0, Don’t make the mistake that I made
1543,4.0," On a positive note, overall, these are great quality genuine Apple headphones"
1544,1.0,"Lost the left then both - wont charge, wont reset and wont pair of course"
1545,1.0," They worked with a new iPhone 12 pro for the time since purchased in Oct 26, 2020 - dead and replaced on June 19, 2021"
1546,5.0,I bought these for my wife as a present and she absolutely loves them
1547,5.0, She has smaller ears and it's hard for her to find comfortable earphones
1548,5.0, She really liked the ones that come with iPhones but she would catch the wire on everything
1549,5.0, I bought her some Bluetooth ones that just didn't fit right so she never used them
1550,5.0,These were exactly what she needed
1551,5.0, The fit her smaller ears and keep her cord-free
1552,5.0, They utilize touch controls on the side of the headphones that are not buttons
1553,5.0," The case is just the right size to carry them in a pocket or purse and it even charges the headphones when you are storing them, even when the case is not plugged in"
1554,5.0," So, when it says ""wired"" in the description, it means that you charge the case via USB but when you unplug it, it has its own battery that charges the ear-buds"
1555,5.0, She's been using them for a couple of weeks so far and I don't think she has charged the case more than once
1556,5.0,"Yes, they are a bit pricey but they are definitely worth it to make her happy"
1557,1.0,I bought these under the impression they were new unused AirPods which they weren’t
1558,1.0, They had been named by a dude who’s name showed up on my iPhone when I went to use the AirPods for the first time
1559,1.0, I googled his name and found him on Instagram
1560,1.0, Shady on the part of Amazon
1561,1.0, On top of that the AirPods don’t hold a charge for more than 3-3
1562,1.0,5 hours
1563,1.0, Not acceptable
1564,1.0, Returning
1565,4.0,I wasn't sure how much I would use or like the AirPods Gen 2 when I first purchased but have really been pleasantly surprised by how often I reach for these over my old trusty wired ear buds
1566,4.0,Fit: I had no issues with fit; the Apple EarBuds always fit comfortably and snugly and these were no different
1567,4.0, I would say though that if the EarBuds didn't fit then the AirPods probably won't fit either
1568,4.0, I've seen some custom accessories to make more snug but imagine they wouldn't sit right in the charging case
1569,4.0,Connectivity: Apple has really made the bluetooth connection seamless which was always a tedious process on other wireless ear buds I've used
1570,4.0, I just pop them in my ear and within seconds I hear the chirp that they're connected - huge plus
1571,4.0,Sound Quality: I would say the sound quality is better than good but not quite excellent
1572,4.0, I think there is room for improvement in that regard
1573,4.0, No interference or anything but the base isn't very deep
1574,4.0,"Battery Life: Again, I would say this is any area where it is better than good but not quite excellent"
1575,4.0, On a full charge the case and buds will get me through about a day and a half before recharging but that is with relatively light usage
1576,4.0," It is convenient that they are recharged with a lightning port as I have them everywhere now (work, car, office)"
1577,4.0,"Overall, I would say I'm very happy with my purchase of the AiPods Gen 2"
1578,4.0,Dope
1579,4.0,once you get them you’ll realize you really needed them 
1580,4.0,lol I know paying $150 is crazy but you’ll see when you get them 
1581,4.0,only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because the AirPods keep disconnecting on Group FaceTime 
1582,4.0,other than that everything good
1583,5.0,This thing performs well in all of the standard headphone categories like:
1584,5.0,- great sound quality
1585,5.0,"- stays in ears (at least mine - i'm a normal sized guy, 5'10"" 190lbs)"
1586,5.0,- great battery life
1587,5.0,- fast charging
1588,5.0,- great noise cancelling
1589,5.0,- works amazing as a 2-way (i use it for conference calls while walking down busy streets and airports all the time and rarely get people saying that background noise is distracting)
1590,5.0,Where this thing blows away all competition is just the magic of how effortlessly it works
1591,5.0, Open the case lid and your phone asks you if you want to set up your new AirPods
1592,5.0," Once it's set up, pop them in your ear and whatever you were playing on the phone goes to your AirPods"
1593,5.0, Then pop them out and whatever you were listening to automatically pauses
1594,5.0, You get helpful little sounds when the battery starts running down
1595,5.0," To charge them, just pop them back into their case (which itself stores probably 4 or 5 full charges for the headphones) and they'll be workable again in about a minute, and fully charged in about 10 minutes"
1596,5.0," (I haven't actually timed this, that's just anecdotal)"
1597,5.0,I get that there are much cheaper wireless headphones out there but anyone who has ever used AirPods can tell you these are another level of convenience and quality
1598,5.0," Once you use these you'll never go back to non-Apple products, at least not for use with an iPhone"
1599,4.0,Pros:
1600,4.0,- I carry them everywhere in my jean's pocket because they are so small
1601,4.0,"- They ""just work"" no lag or trying to get them to pair to bluetooth, they always connect and work"
1602,4.0,Neutral:
1603,4.0,"- Battery life is good for how small the buds are, but the case is great in that it has extra charge capability"
1604,4.0,Cons:
1605,4.0,- I can only wear them for 45mins tops before my ears start to hurt
1606,4.0, Very uncomfortable any longer than that
1607,4.0,- Sounds quality has a lot to be desired
1608,4.0, I cant tell if they are just bad or that the Beats PowerBeats Pro are amazing
1609,4.0,Overall:
1610,4.0,You cant win
1611,4.0," If you want longer lasting, more comfortable, amazing sound wireless buds, you need to get the PowerBeats Pro"
1612,4.0," But if you get those, you will NEVER bring them with you because the case is HUGE"
1613,4.0, I ended up buying both these airpods and Powerbeats Pro and couldnt be happier
1614,4.0,"Though I dislike the fit and sound, these are still 4 stars because for basic podcasts, quick music at the work desk, calls, and of course how small they are, it more than offsets the cons"
1615,4.0," But trust me, there is no way these could ever be rated 5 stars"
1616,1.0,Ridiculus 
1617,1.0," Box was opened and the sticker not gluing anymore, the cable is dirty and with marks of being plugged, the box of the earplugs have many scratches in both sides"
1618,1.0,definitely a used item
1619,1.0, No doubt
1620,1.0," While checking again the item in Amazon, to see if I have missed something, it was there ""NEW"""
1621,1.0," Sold as new, but is it just a used item"
1622,1.0, This might be my bad luck or just Amazon trying to get rid of things returned after Christmas
1623,1.0,I used them for about 1 month and all of the sudden my left pod won’t work anymore
1624,1.0, When I first got them the left pod always had a hard time connecting to the case and often gave me the red exclamation point error message
1625,1.0," After messing with it I could usually get it to connect, but now it has stopped working all together"
1626,1.0," Because Apple wants $90 for a new pod, I might as well just buy a new set"
1627,1.0," I loved them for the month I had them, but I’m so disappointed to have spent that much money on a pair of headphones that I can no longer use"
1628,1.0, I will not be buying another set
1629,1.0, I just wouldn’t recommend
1630,1.0,These are used AirPods
1631,1.0, I received a box that looked like it had been in the garbage and the AirPods themselves were dirty
1632,1.0, I was not expecting used AirPods and I even checked the description to make sure I didn’t miss anything
1633,1.0, No where did it say they were going to be used or refurbished
1634,1.0, So I contacted support
1635,1.0, I asked why the item was used and it didn’t say it was on the description and the rep really made it seem like they did not want to answer my question and just asked me if I could return the item
1636,1.0, I asked if they were authentic Apple AirPods and if they would be new and she said yes so I agreed to get a replacement
1637,1.0, The replacement was also a used or refurbished pair
1638,1.0, Oh and the original pair I received wouldn’t even pair to my iPhone
1639,1.0, I’ve returned both sets and am still waiting for a refund weeks after I returned them
1640,1.0,"When these work, they do exactly what you want them to do and are awesome"
1641,1.0," Unfortunately, when they don't, they can be extremely frustrating if you are in the middle of a phone or video conversation and they just cut out or sound comes out of only one earphone"
1642,1.0, This happens to me about 1/3 of the time
1643,1.0," At this price, they should be more reliable"
1644,1.0," Also, if you are walking with even the slightest of breeze, they amplify that to the point in which it is very difficult for the person on the receiving end to hear you"
1645,1.0,EDIT: I have had nothing but problems with these and ended up just throwing them away
1646,1.0, A waste of a whole lot of money
1647,5.0,"Good sound, though I’m 63 and not an audiophile"
1648,5.0, But you can’t beat them for convenience
1649,5.0, Great for walking due to Siri based controls
1650,5.0," Siri also let’s me look unfamiliar words while listening to audiobooks, which I love"
1651,5.0," Only earbuds I’ve ever found that stay in my ears, yet so light and comfortable that I forget I have them in"
1652,5.0, Not exactly a fashion statement in my opinion
1653,5.0," I joke that, with the white protuberances going down out of the years of an older guy, it looks like his hearing aids are melting"
1654,5.0," But yeah, very very good and reliable product, pairs perfectly every time with no dropped signal, really excellently designed all the way around"
1655,1.0,"If I hadn't authenticated the serial number, I'd seriously think I was sold a counterfeit product"
1656,1.0," Since this is an authentic, new product, I'm just left to believe the product is mediocre at best"
1657,1.0,I regularly use my air pods on both iOS and Android devices
1658,1.0," The air pods connect relatively quickly and easily to both, but especially with other Apple devices"
1659,1.0," (For some reason, the max volume is significantly lower on my Android device"
1660,1.0,) The Bluetooth range is not great with reception starting to break up if you move more than 4-5' away from the phone
1661,1.0," The sound is pretty clear, but less than 10 weeks after purchase, individual ear buds will cut in and out or get static-y even while sitting stationary next to my phone"
1662,1.0," Like other reviewers, my individual ear buds don't seem to charge evenly with one often dying well before the second"
1663,1.0, I've also been disappointed with the battery performance
1664,1.0," The ear buds re-charge quickly when inserted into the case and I'd say I can probably get 5 hours of run time between charges of the *case*, but I struggle to regularly get more than 2 hours of run time per full charge of the ear buds (and oftentimes not even that)"
1665,1.0," Finally, I have no idea how people wear these all the time as I found the shape of the air pods to be tremendously uncomfortable"
1666,1.0, (Though I am aware accessories exist to mitigate this issue)
1667,1.0,I truly don't understand the effuse praise heaped upon air pods
1668,1.0, I am deeply underwhelmed
1669,1.0,NNO AIRPODS IN THE BOX
1670,1.0,Bought it for my wife’s Christmas present
1671,1.0, When opened there was NO AIRPODS in the box 
1672,1.0,What a horrible experience
1673,1.0, Waiting for refund
1674,1.0,The only things in box were instructions and charging cord
1675,5.0,Easy to set up and easy to use
1676,5.0, Pods have a substantial weight and feel good in the ear
1677,5.0, Sound quality is high fidelity
1678,5.0," Intuitive controls -tap for next selection, ask it to raise or lower volume and it does"
1679,5.0," A full charge gives ample battery life for a +/- 6-hour listening session, Recharge quickly and, generally worthy of the Apple brand"
1680,5.0, Recommend buying an aftermarket accessory kit with a silicone cover for the charger and a lariat to allow you to hang the Airpods around your neck for a short time when you want to
1681,5.0,UPDATE MY REVIEW: I have been enjoying my Apple AirPods for almost a year now and I want to add this to my initial review
1682,5.0,"After purchasing my AirPods, I purchased a silicone sleeve for the charger case with came with a Caribiner and a lariat to hold the Airpods and allow them to hang around my neck when I took them out of ears"
1683,5.0,"A few days ago I attached the carabiner to the belt loop of my jeans for an afternoon of cycling and at the end of the day, I tossed the jeans into the wash not realizing the AirPods were still attached to the belt loop"
1684,5.0," After washing the jeans I threw them in the dryer and within a few minutes, I began to hear something solid banging around in the dryer"
1685,5.0," Upon opening the dryer, I found the silicone charger case - empty"
1686,5.0," Searching the clothes, I discovered the charger case with the Airpods inside"
1687,5.0,I took the silicone case and the AirPods Charger out of the dryer and was very sure they were destroyed - they were NOT
1688,5.0, I opened the case and put the AirPods in my ears and was shocked to discover they worked as well as ever and they had no indication of damge at all
1689,5.0,The AirPods are obviously water-resistant - My thanks to the Apple engineers for anticipating they would be used by careless old men who do some stupid things
1690,3.0,"The AirPods arrived in great condition, nice packaging but they do not stay put in my ear at all"
1691,3.0, I attempted to wear one around the house while doing light chores and it fell out several times and required adjusting multiple times
1692,3.0," I should have known that these wouldn’t work for me, my regular corded earbuds do the same thing"
1693,3.0, I don’t imagine that I’d be able to workout or do much of anything without them falling out
1694,3.0, I’ll be returning them and purchasing a much more inexpensive pair that allows me to adjust the ear cover for a better fit
1695,3.0," Good product for most, but not a good fit for me"
1696,3.0,Update 5/14/20
1697,3.0,So these are advertised as being the latest generation
1698,3.0, My case that came with the AirPods have a model number that would indicate the case is 1st generation
1699,3.0, The AirPods have different model numbers that would indicate that they weren’t manufactured as pair
1700,3.0, There’s something fishy with these although they work
1701,3.0, Check your numbers
1702,3.0,my settings on my phone show a model number that is in fact different than what’s printed on the actual device
1703,3.0," I wouldn’t be surprised if these were refurbished, all the different serial numbers confirm that this wasn’t an original pair because they have different manufacture dates"
1704,5.0,"As an audiophile, I resisted getting these for a long time"
1705,5.0, But they don’t sound bad and the convenience and ease of use is off the charts
1706,5.0, AirPods are a very well designed and useful accessory to any Apple device
1707,5.0, Battery life is acceptable given their tiny size
1708,5.0,"I bought them first for my wife, who’s never had true wireless ear buds and doesn’t care as much about sound quality as me"
1709,5.0, She’s also not particularly into gadgets and tech like I am
1710,5.0, She loves these things like the sister she never had
1711,5.0,"We both find that they fit well, stay put, and are comfortable, and our ears are very different size & shape"
1712,5.0,"When I’m doing serious listening to music, I have other earphones I can use"
1713,5.0," Otherwise, I reach for the AirPods because they’re so easy and a joy to use"
1714,5.0, I’m happy I bought them
1715,5.0,They also work great for cellular phone calls and for Zoom meetings
1716,1.0,"Let me start this review by saying that I'm using these pods with a Blackberry Priv that has an Android OS, so take that FWIW"
1717,1.0," Maybe they aren't compatible, or optimally compatible, or whatever since they're an Apple device"
1718,1.0," I don't know, but the point of having them is to be able to listen to my phone without wires, and they don't allow that very well"
1719,1.0,"The range is limited, like less than a few feet, and depending on where I'm using them it's less than that"
1720,1.0," For example, I can be at the gym on an incline bench, set my phone on the floor next to me, and the podcast that I'm listening to cuts out"
1721,1.0, Maybe there's interference from the gym's piped in music - they work well enough when they're about 10 inches away from me in the rack on the elliptical machine
1722,1.0,This afternoon I was washing my car in my garage
1723,1.0," When I was washing the tires I left the phone on the hood of the car, and when I went to wash the rear tires, my podcast cut out"
1724,1.0, I ended up turning them off them and using the speaker in the phone
1725,1.0,The only time these pods really work is when I'm driving and I have my phone on my lap
1726,1.0," YMMV depending on how, when, and where you use them"
1727,1.0,Love them
1728,1.0, I was concerned at first that they would fall out but they don’t
1729,1.0, I use them to work out lifting weights or cardio without them moving
1730,1.0, Craziness
1731,1.0, Great sound and battery life
1732,1.0, If you are looking for noise canceling then these are not the headphones for you
1733,1.0,***Update 10/6/2019***
1734,1.0,I have had them about 5 months now and the last 2 months I am having issues with the left ear pod staying charged or connecting
1735,1.0, I have gone through all the troubleshooting online of cleaning and reconnecting with it only to happen again and again
1736,1.0, It is very frustrating to have both pod's 100% charged at night and then during my workout in the morning the left one dies 20 minutes in
1737,1.0,Well I bought these “New” off amazon
1738,1.0, We were having problems with one charging
1739,1.0," Apple was great trying to help, but the serial # is not an Apple # and apparently these were sold as new but they were refurbished"
1740,1.0," Tell tell sign, this is not our Apple name we assigned them"
1741,1.0, LIES AMAZON
1742,1.0,Completely annoyed
1743,1.0, I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter
1744,1.0, Website made it look like they were coming direct from the Apple store in new condition
1745,1.0, I just took them out of the shipping package and this is what the box looked like
1746,1.0, Not sealed in the clear wrap
1747,1.0, Nasty stuff all over the bottom of the box
1748,1.0, A sticker placed over another one that tells me these are “New item
1749,1.0,” I’m not believing it for a second
1750,1.0," I don’t know what is going on, but I feel like something fishy just happened"
1751,1.0," As far as AirPods, I have a pair and love them"
1752,1.0, Just wish this pair would have been new in the package instead of this nasty thing
1753,1.0, Am returning today
1754,4.0,"I finally got tired of trying to find ear buds that could compare to Apple, and I decided to just spend the money and get Apple"
1755,4.0," I’m not sorry that I did, but I do wish that I had gotten the Pros"
1756,4.0, I had Apple phones for years & always promptly gave away the included wired earbuds that come with the phones
1757,4.0, They never ever stay in my ear if I move my head at all
1758,4.0, The reason I went ahead about bought these anyway is because I found that I could purchase a set of silicone hooks that slip over them to hold the bud in my ear
1759,4.0, They are perfect with that little hook which reminds me of the build of my favorite Bose headphones
1760,4.0," The hook is simple enough to put on, however…"
1761,4.0, I don’t love having to take them back off after each listen because they obviously won’t allow the bud to charge in the case
1762,4.0, I knew that before I ordered and simply didn’t think it would be as annoying as it is
1763,4.0," Bottom line, the ear buds themselves are awesome; best wireless listening experience I’ve ever owned & I am not at all sorry that I bought them"
1764,4.0," About a month after I got them, my daughter bought the Pros"
1765,4.0, I put them on one time & was immediately sorry that I hadn’t chosen to pony up the extra money for them
1766,4.0," They are worth it & in my personal opinion, actually sound better due to the complete seal in the ear"
1767,2.0,I love these air pods
1768,2.0, Price finally came down from the original price when they first came out so I went for them
1769,2.0, The last pair of head phones I owned was back when the wired version was around so it’s been a few years
1770,2.0, These sounds great
1771,2.0, love having no wires
1772,2.0, They stay in my ears no problem
1773,2.0, I didn’t want noise cancelling headphones so these are perfect
1774,2.0, I like them especially at the gym hearing what’s going on around me
1775,2.0, I feel almost unsafe with noise canceling headphones
1776,2.0, battery life is great
1777,2.0, I highly recommend buying these
1778,2.0,Update:
1779,2.0,The right AirPod has been slowly going bad over the last couple weeks and now it’s always at 1% life when I open the up to pair them
1780,2.0, That’s with 100% charged case
1781,2.0, They’ll start charging when I open the case
1782,2.0, great while they lasted
1783,2.0, Used indoors only to
1784,2.0, disappointed especially for the price I expect better from Apple
1785,4.0,They do get a little sore in my ears after a while
1786,4.0, I wish the battery lasted just a smidge longer
1787,4.0," I generally use them while doing things around the house, and they will last a few hours"
1788,4.0, The sound quality is very good
1789,4.0, The input quality is better than the standard corded ear buds
1790,4.0, It picks up my voice better
1791,4.0, Noise cancellation is comparable to the standard ear buds
1792,4.0,My biggest complaint is that these were not clean when I received them
1793,4.0, I opted for the open box to get a discount on these
1794,4.0, The description indicated that the box may have been opened and possibly damaged
1795,4.0," However, it did not indicate that the item had been previously used"
1796,4.0," And especially considering the current pandemic situation, particular care should have been taken to ensure that the item had been cleaned"
1797,4.0, I spent about 20 minutes scraping ear wax out of the ear buds
1798,4.0, Gross
1799,4.0," And if you have had any Apple ear bud before, you know that it is very difficult to get into all of those tiny little crevices"
1800,4.0, I sincerely wish that Amazon had taken a little more care in the processing of returns such as this
1801,5.0,Greatest earphones ever
1802,5.0,"I don’t know how I ever lived without these, seriously, not just the earphones but the great little case that they come in that charges your ear buds even when it’s not plugged in so perfect to have when you’re traveling"
1803,5.0,"The ear buds not only allow you you to call people by simply saying “hey Siri” but it answers any questions, it reads and composed text messages if I ask, it plays music etc"
1804,5.0, etc
1805,5.0, Simply ask and you shall receive
1806,5.0,"I can now cook with my hands full while dancing to the beat of any song I ask Siri to play, ask Siri to take notes for me or even help give me recipe ideas"
1807,5.0,Once you’ve used these you will also ask yourself how you ever lived without it as it makes your life so much easier
1808,5.0,The sound is fantastic along with the noise reduction and whomever I’m speaking with hears me well
1809,5.0,These are pricey but I assure you they are worth every penny you pay
1810,1.0,"When I initially got the headphones, I was fascinated by how awesome they sounded"
1811,1.0," I would put them on and could basically hear in HD and the noise cancellation works, even with no music on"
1812,1.0,"Buuut, that only lasted a few months"
1813,1.0, I bought them Sept
1814,1.0," 2020 and up until about a month ago (2/21), they worked perfectly"
1815,1.0," Now, the sound only comes out from the little side speakers and not the main ones (it happened to both headphones), so the sound volume was reduced DRAMATICALLY"
1816,1.0,"Now they just sound like cheap wireless headphones (maybe worse), and the only way to be able to hear it a bit better is by twisting it so the side speaker is facing my eardrum, but that makes it loose, so it falls out easily"
1817,1.0,"Safe to say, I’m most likely not going to be buying Apple products from Amazon and might just stick to buying them directly from the Apple Store, because it seems like I got a defective pair and I’m not alone"
1818,5.0,"I’ve had my own for over a year now and my sister had been dropping subtle hints about getting a pair such as( hey, buy me AirPods) or (did you buy my pods already"
1819,5.0,) or my favorite ( get my AirPods or I’ll take yours
1820,5.0,)
1821,5.0," Siblings are so funny, anyway since she took mine I figured, this would be the best time to buy a new pair for myself so I did and they arrived rather quickly"
1822,5.0, Now guess who’s got two thumbs and his old AirPods back
1823,5.0,…… THIS GUY
1824,1.0,These pods were a Christmas gift to a 14y/o who was waiting months for them
1825,1.0, They worked half a day
1826,1.0," Went through the hassle of 2 appointments at the Apple store, the first trip they said it was the case and gave me a new one without testing it first even though I requested a test"
1827,1.0," Well, they never worked and had to schedule another trip there and they said it was one of the earpieces and when I explained the first trip the clerk said ""it's never the case"" and was given a new earpiece"
1828,1.0, Now they work
1829,1.0, If known this would have happened and the poor Apple service
1830,1.0,I would have rethought the purchase
1831,4.0,"Ever since I switched from Android and PC, I've become Apple-centric"
1832,4.0," Since Apple products like Apple products, I decided to buy some Air Pods"
1833,4.0," Amazon's Prime Day price of $114 finally brought them down to what I considered a little bit better price, so I bought them"
1834,4.0,Pros:
1835,4.0,1
1836,4.0, They connect very quickly with all my Apple devices
1837,4.0,2
1838,4.0, The sound quality is a few steps above some of the other ear buds I've had
1839,4.0," The stereo is good, and while they don't have enough bass for me, they don't sound tinny either"
1840,4.0,3
1841,4.0," They fit fairly comfortably in my ears, although the right pod fits better that the left one does"
1842,4.0, Maybe I have an oddly-shaped left ear
1843,4.0,4
1844,4.0," So far, neither pod has fallen out of my ears"
1845,4.0," However, I've worn them mainly in the house, so I don't know how it would be if I was running"
1846,4.0," That, I'll never know because I don't run anywhere"
1847,4.0,5
1848,4.0," The case opens very easily, and the pods are fairly easy to remove"
1849,4.0, I really appreciate this because my Jabra case is so hard to open that I would often have to get my husband to do it for me
1850,4.0,6
1851,4.0," I love, love, love the fact that I can say ""Hey Siri,"" and get so many things done"
1852,4.0," I was watching an Amazon Prime show on my iPad Pro the other day, and I told Siri to mute the volume, and she did it"
1853,4.0," However, when I said to un mute, that didn't happen"
1854,4.0, Maybe I need to figure out some other terminology for that
1855,4.0," When I said to rewind a couple of seconds, it did that, too"
1856,4.0, This is a really great feature
1857,4.0,Cons:
1858,4.0,1
1859,4.0," Other than the price, the one thing that kept me from buying these was how silly they look with that long white stem protruding out the ear"
1860,4.0," One person said they look like a hair dryer, and they do"
1861,4.0," I have noticed that the Air Pods Pro have a much shorter stem, and thus they look more normal"
1862,4.0," I guess when the get down low enough in price, I'll probably buy them and give these to a friend or relative"
1863,4.0,2
1864,4.0," They don't have noise cancellation, which I would really love to have"
1865,4.0, I guess I'll have to wait for the Pros for that
1866,4.0,3
1867,4.0," I didn't realize that they had wired and wireless charging versions, and I ended up with the wired ones"
1868,4.0," However, I bought a wireless charging case for less than $10 from Amazon Warehouse, so I'm going to see if that works"
1869,4.0,"Overall, other than some of the cons I mentioned, I really do like these"
1870,4.0," They connect quickly, have a pretty good sound, and the hands-free Siri feature is great"
1871,4.0," However, I would say that if you can afford them, you should get the Air Pods Pro because they look better, and they have more features"
1872,4.0," If you can't, these would be a great stop-gap measure until the Pros go down in price"
1873,5.0,This is my first pair of AirPods
1874,5.0, I love them
1875,5.0, They are life-changing
1876,5.0, The AirPods arrived in less than 24-hours of ordering
1877,5.0," They were packaged in a sleek, white Apple AirPods box"
1878,5.0," I did not buy the ""noise-canceling"" AirPods, so I cannot rate that feature, but as far as the product appearance, sound quality, ease of use, great fit, easy to pair on Bluetooth, etc"
1879,5.0, I wholeheartedly give these AirPods 5 shiny gold starts
1880,2.0,You’ll have to buy a new pair in under a year
1881,2.0," I bought 4 sets for me and my kids less than a year ago, and 3 of them don’t work anymore, already"
1882,2.0," They worked great, while they worked"
1883,2.0," Then in 6 months, 1 air pod starts dying periodically, then permanently, then the other"
1884,2.0," Now only 1 pair remains, and it’s only because I hardly ever use them"
1885,2.0, These were a waste of money
1886,5.0,"I held out for so long on buying a pair of AirPods, I always felt like they were priced a little too high for what you get at the end of the day"
1887,5.0," I get it now though, their value is more in how these work with all your other Apple hardware than it is from the AirPods themselves"
1888,5.0,"These are still to this day in 2021, one of the smallest charging cases of a pair of true wireless headphones, even though the design is unchanged from 2016 when they were announced alongside the iPhone 7/7 Plus"
1889,5.0, That’s pretty incredible for back then
1890,5.0,"In the box, you get a standard USB A to Lightning cable, the AirPods and charging case"
1891,5.0, This is the 2nd generation AirPods with the H1 chip on board for “hey Siri” functionality
1892,5.0," It works really well and allows the AirPods to seamlessly switch between any iOS devices, TVOS, WatchOS, and newer MacOS devices"
1893,5.0," If they are connected to your iPhone and you pull out your iPad to watch a quick video, the audio from that video would be automatically routed through the Airpods"
1894,5.0," This is after the initial setup, which only requires you to hold down the pairing button and then follow the prompts in the on screen pop ups"
1895,5.0," If you open the charging case within a few inches of an iOS device, you get a cute little pop up that will display the battery level of both the AirPods and the case"
1896,5.0," Apple’s software is good and pleasant to use, that is why products like these are worth their premium prices- the tight integration of hardware and software working together to create an amazing experience that is largely unrivaled today by any other tech company"
1897,5.0,"The sound quality here is good, the open style of these headphones makes it easy to hear the world around you (this can be both good and bad)"
1898,5.0," There are better sounding headphones for this price, but not any that work this way"
1899,5.0," If sound quality is of great importance, perhaps look at the AirPods Pro or wait a few months until they refresh the base level AirPods with a design that has the ear tips (this is a rumor, but it’s probably a safe bet that the entry level AirPods will get a major design change)"
1900,5.0,"These also tie into Airplay 2, and this allows for audio sharing where one iPhone can play audio on 2 sets of AirPods"
1901,5.0, There are also other little perks like Siri will read out you iMessages to you (this can be paused or turned off entirely)
1902,5.0, There is a cool accessibility option called “live listen” you can enable it in control center
1903,5.0, This will use your iPhone’s microphones to play the audio it hears into the AirPods
1904,5.0, This kind of gives it an ambient or pass through mode like headphones with ANC have
1905,5.0,"If you do pick these up in 2021, just be aware that this is a nearly 2 year old product and could be replaced with a newer version as soon as March"
1906,5.0," No one ever really knows what Apple will release or when, but the chances are high"
1907,5.0," That said though, the H1 chip is likely to still be used in the soon to be released pair, so there shouldn’t be a huge difference in terms of new features"
1908,4.0,Had a bout of bad luck with Apple's AirPods:
1909,4.0,First Pair
1910,4.0,"After about three months, one side stopped working completely"
1911,4.0,Second Pair
1912,4.0,The first pair was still within Amazon's return period so I got a replacement set
1913,4.0, This pair wouldn't connect to any phone whatsoever
1914,4.0," So, I returned them"
1915,4.0,Third Pair
1916,4.0,The third pair finally worked as intended
1917,4.0, Sounds great and I love the battery life
1918,4.0, Much better than other Bluetooth equivalents especially for an iPhone
1919,4.0, Just wish that I didn't have to go through the misery of two returns
1920,1.0,I was excited to see that these Airpods were part of Amazon's Prime special the other day
1921,1.0, I already have a pair but the battery life doesn't quite make it through a full work day
1922,1.0, I justified a 2nd pair to hold me over on a full days work
1923,1.0,When I initially got the order I didn't notice anything odd about the packaging
1924,1.0, It looked and felt authentic
1925,1.0," After taking a careful look at the product, I noticed that the lid was not completely flush with the body on the back side of the charging case"
1926,1.0, I compared the Apple Air Pods I already have to these and the weight and durability of the plastic seemed different but I couldn't tell for sure
1927,1.0, After charging them all night the charge only showed 88%
1928,1.0, That was the defining moment that I realized I purchased yet another dupe on Amazon
1929,1.0, Don't waste your time and purchase directly from Apple
1930,5.0,I purchased these for my husband for father's day
1931,5.0, I kept going back and forth between the Bose SoundSport and the Airpods
1932,5.0, I have the QC35 and I love them for work since they are noise-cancelling
1933,5.0," For my husband's purposes (at work, when doing yardwork, etc"
1934,5.0,) he did not headphones at the QC35's level
1935,5.0, Overall it was the ease of the airpods and the charging case that really drove my purchase
1936,5.0, It's been one week (opened them early) and he loves them-- the only hesitation I have is him losing them (so compact
1937,5.0,)
1938,5.0, For everyday use and ease of use with apple products I would definitely recommend
1939,3.0,The battery life is OK
1940,3.0," Thankfully, I use one at a time and I can put one away to charge and pop another one in my other ear"
1941,3.0, I wouldn’t suggest wearing both and expecting to wear them for a long period of time
1942,3.0, They do charge very quickly though
1943,3.0, I love that
1944,3.0, I noticed this popping noise pretty soon after they arrived
1945,3.0, Within the first 24 hours
1946,3.0," I contacted Amazon customer service about, spoke with a very nice gentleman who assured me he would call the next day to follow up after suggesting I disconnect and re-pair them with my phone"
1947,3.0," This did help initially but within that 24 hours, the popping/crackling noise was back"
1948,3.0," Of course, he never followed up"
1949,3.0, I went ahead and kept them after reading this is an issue with AirPods
1950,3.0, Didn’t want to go through the trouble of returning just for it to happen again
1951,3.0," Anyways, I figured I’d hit em where it hurts, the review"
1952,3.0," Despite the noise, they are great"
1953,3.0," I use them quite a bit BUT if you find another brand that does the same thing for half the price, that makes sense too"
1954,5.0,I expected to not get the same sound quality out of these as the wired version since they are the same design and it's bluetooth
1955,5.0," But, along with my now HD audio Amazon music account (thank you Apple"
1956,5.0,) the music sounds great
1957,5.0, I like the integration with Siri so that she reads texts that come in and announces calls
1958,5.0," Double tap feature is configurable, like my left ear is stop/start and right ear is next track"
1959,5.0," Also, if you take one out, whatever is playing, music or video stops and then starts when you pop it back in"
1960,5.0," Additionally, I like this ""old"" design because those new squishy rubber tipped things never stay in my ears"
1961,5.0, Battery life is pretty good
1962,5.0," I haven't measured it, but I can usually get away with all day with occasional listening"
1963,5.0, Cons:
1964,5.0,"sound is a little less bass heavy, but there still is some, definitely not ""tinny"""
1965,5.0," Battery could be better, but I mean they are tiny"
1966,5.0," Very little to complain about really, definitely happy with this purchase, I recommend them"
1967,2.0,I bought this as a birthday gift for myself and my friend has been raving about AirPods so I wanted to try it for myself
1968,2.0," The sound quality is okay but when I listen to death metal, it just sounds like people are screaming"
1969,2.0, Noise concellation is okay but not as good as the airpod pros
1970,2.0, The battery life is not good
1971,2.0, I used this airpod for a few hours and it needs to be charged again
1972,2.0, This is only for people who is okay with charging their airpod after a few hour use
1973,2.0, There are other earbuds that have a better sound quality and a longer battery life
1974,4.0,I finally decided to take the plunge and purchase these when they were on sale
1975,4.0," I just couldn’t see paying the full retail price for headphones, no matter how good they were supposed to be"
1976,4.0," Despite the less than perfect fit in my left ear, I do not regret my purchase, the sound is excellent whether you are listening to something, or speaking on the phone"
1977,4.0," While the battery life can always be improved on devices like these, the wired case makes charging easy (I love how the sound slowly decreases to let you know you battery cycle is nearly at an end)"
1978,4.0," While the cheap in me will likely never be able to justify paying full price for a more advanced and more comfortable version, which the pros are reported to be, I do see me one day upgrading to the Pros if I catch a good sale"
1979,5.0,"I am an android user, and I generally stay away from Apple products due to their higher price, and inflexibility of integration with non apple products"
1980,5.0," My son had a pair of pods, which I tried with my Samsung Galaxy phone - when I saw how great they are, I had to purchase a pair for myself, and I have had it over over a month now"
1981,5.0,1) Pairing is effortless and quick
1982,5.0,"2) Quality is amazing - crisp, clear"
1983,5.0,3) Battery life has been great so far
1984,5.0," I've been listening to audio books while walking for 2-3 hours at a time, and battery lasted more than that without needed to recharge in the case"
1985,5.0,4) I don't feel that they are in my ears
1986,5.0," They are so light and comfortable, that sometimes I have to touch my ear to make sure that they didn't fall off"
1987,5.0," Any other pods, my ear starts to feel an annoying dull pain after some time - but not with these"
1988,5.0, They've been in my ear for over 3 hours without any discomfort
1989,5.0,5) Speaking of falling off - they won't
1990,5.0," The design is fantastic, so unless you're flicking them off on purpose - they will stay in the ear"
1991,5.0," I had worked out with them (push ups, stomach crunches, etc"
1992,5.0,"), and never had to adjust them"
1993,5.0,"6) I am not looking for noise cancellation features with pods, because when I go for walks, I want to be able to hear ambiance noise for awareness"
1994,5.0," While they not intended to block noise, they do a good job in transmitting strong and clear sound"
1995,5.0, I often times have to reduce the volume to be able to still hear ambiance noise when outdoors
1996,5.0," Next to a busy street, I do need to increase the volume, but that's expected"
1997,5.0,"I don't use the gestures much, so can't comment on their responsiveness/usefulness, but I feel like a fool for wasting money on knock off brands for a third of the price, to see how terrible terrible their quality is in comparison (sound quality, pairing dependability, comfort)"
1998,5.0," Also, this is not a wireless case, so you will need to charge with a cable"
1999,5.0,"Overall, this is a solid piece of engineering that I would strongly recommend over any knockoff or other competitors"
2000,3.0,Very nice 
2001,3.0, Only ear buds that fit
2002,3.0,* update * after 6 weeks the batteries wouldn’t charge completely 
2003,3.0,Apple support directed me 3 hours from my house for repair 
2004,3.0," When I told her there’s a Best Buy 4 miles from my house , she confirmed that they could handle it "
2005,3.0," I was told if the problem was not my fault , they would be replaced on the spot "
2006,3.0," In reality , if you don’t purchase from Best Buy , they send them in for repair "
2007,3.0,"I really like the product , and am looking forward to their return "
2008,3.0,** update ** just received repaired airpods 
2009,3.0, 2 days 
2010,3.0, Excellent service 
2011,3.0, They failed again after one use 
2012,3.0, Same problem 
2013,3.0, Bestbuy offered to return them again 
2014,3.0, I declined
2015,3.0, I bought a new pair from Bestbuy and I will return the haunted pair to Amazon tomorrow 
2016,1.0,My third set of airPods died and were just three months old
2017,1.0, This time I decided to contact Apple online support as many of my friends have had terrible support at the local store
2018,1.0, After 35 minutes of back and forth with the online support is was determined that I had to supply my credit card and mail in the airPods so they could determine if they needed to charge me for repairing my airPods that are under warranty
2019,1.0, I did not want to supply my credit card as it should not be needed for a three month old product that is under warranty
2020,1.0, Therefore Apple informed me that they could not help me
2021,1.0, I was very disappointed as now I'm shopping for another brand and having to spend money that I just spend three months ago
2022,1.0, The service from large companies just keeps getting worse and worse; which is to bad
2023,1.0, We spend a lot of money on these products and just want to enjoy them
2024,1.0,I received them and they are used
2025,1.0, They pulled up as “Angie’s iPod”
2026,1.0, What is this
2027,1.0, And they’re dirty
2028,1.0, Do not purchase from this seller
2029,1.0, Used and gross
2030,1.0, I do not know how they sound I won’t wear them
2031,1.0,It’s been 2 weeks
2032,1.0, The left one runs out and does not charge all the way up
2033,1.0, I am returning
2034,5.0,"As many have said before, the batt life on these Airpods is nothing short of great"
2035,5.0, The case is the key to extended life
2036,5.0, Comfort
2037,5.0," For most people, the comfort level is outstanding"
2038,5.0," My left ear does have issues different from most, so the unit keeps popping out during exercise"
2039,5.0, Installing the little slip covers seemed to correct this
2040,5.0, (Silicon based) I've heard a few complaints regarding sound quality
2041,5.0, Not so for me
2042,5.0," I just twist them a bit so the main speaker is directed to my ear canal, and the sound is about the best I've heard"
2043,5.0," These are great for the price, and I predict the Pro version prices will go down after the holidays if you want to hold off and spend up to 50% less"
2044,5.0, The only real difference with the Pro version is the end pieces
2045,5.0, (Will stay in your ears better than standard
2046,5.0,) I paid $165
2047,5.0,00 for these
2048,5.0, Worth every penny I think
2049,1.0,Had the airpods for 4 months and they were amazing
2050,1.0," Sound quality was great, felt very comfortable, the whole nine yards"
2051,1.0, I loved these earbuds
2052,1.0," After 4 months, without warning it just stopped working"
2053,1.0," It connects to my Samsung phone, but it doesn't play any sound"
2054,1.0," Ok weird, I'll just put it back in the case and take it out again (disconnect then reconnect)"
2055,1.0, Still the same issue
2056,1.0, Try to unpair the earbuds and pair them back and still nothing
2057,1.0, Put the earbuds in the case and held the button to reset it until it gets that amber light and still nothing
2058,1.0," I then thought ok maybe it's because I'm not using an iPhone, so I get my old IPhone 6 and try to connect it to that and see if it fixes it and what do ya know nothing"
2059,1.0, I kept resetting it so many times and I finally got one earbud to play sound
2060,1.0," Right earbud plays sound and left one doesn't, ok cool progress"
2061,1.0, I tried resetting it a couple more times and now the left one plays sound but the right one doesn't
2062,1.0, Continued resetting it and now the right earbud plays sound but the left one doesn't
2063,1.0," It sucks, but at least I can still use one earbud"
2064,1.0," I'll continue to try and see if I can get both ear buds to work and if I do I'll update this review, but until then It's a 1 star for me :/"
2065,4.0,"After having these for about a day, it feels amazing to not have a wire"
2066,4.0," I can move freely without worrying about pulling my headphones out accidentally, especially while I am at work carrying boxes"
2067,4.0,One complaint that some people have is that the airpods fall out or don’t fit their ears
2068,4.0," I haven’t had this problem, and they fit perfectly"
2069,4.0," I haven’t tried to run with them in yet, so I’m not sure how they stay in while I am running"
2070,4.0,I do advise being careful when taking them out of the case though
2071,4.0, They are really small and they could fall if you don’t grab them when they come off the charger in the case
2072,4.0,They connect to apple devices EXTREMELY easily
2073,4.0," All that is required is you open the case and hold it up near your device while the case is opened, and pair from the popup on your phone"
2074,4.0, Regular bluetooth connections are possible by holding the button down on the back of the case
2075,5.0,"This is my third pair of Airpods, which may seem strange to some, given they first came out in 2016, however if you use these as much as I do you will wear the battery out over time"
2076,5.0, Since the charging case is pocket size you can always carry these with you and since the case contains a seperate battery they're always charging in your pocket
2077,5.0," Connecting is a breeze, 1"
2078,5.0," Open flap, 2"
2079,5.0, Do you wish to connect airpods 
2080,5.0, -> Connect 3
2081,5.0, Done
2082,5.0,Airpods with or without wireless charging case
2083,5.0,"I have a wireless charging pad and a lightning cable next to my bed and rarely used the pad for wireless charging of these, would just stick with the lightning charged case if you don't need a full charge every day"
2084,5.0, I only need to charge weekly and since you can charge the case without having the airpods in the case I sometimes plonk it in the charger when I'm going to do stuff around the house and want to use the airpods
2085,5.0,Airpods or Airpods Pro 
2086,5.0,"I have both kinds and I really like both types, for different scenarios"
2087,5.0," When using public transport or really need noise cancelling the Pro's shine, however for extended use, > 1 hour, when riding a bike, out for a walk, eating and listening I go for the classic airpods, they're just more comfortable to wear, you barely know they're there"
2088,2.0,"Inevitably, one of the airpods always stops working, but it is not always the same one"
2089,2.0, It swtiches ears
2090,2.0, It takes several attempts to unpair and re-pair to get them both to work
2091,2.0, I wear them to run
2092,2.0, I have sometimes gotten less than a mile into my run when one quits working
2093,2.0, It is ridiculous
2094,2.0, I paid the extra money thinking they would function as expected
2095,2.0, Disappointed
2096,1.0,I had first generation AirPods and they lasted almost two years
2097,1.0," I was planning to buy new pair but I wasn’t in the rush because they still worked, sound was decent and battery would last me 2-3 hours before I had to put them on the charger"
2098,1.0," Somehow I misplaced them so instead of looking for them, I decided to buy a pair on Amazon"
2099,1.0," They were cheaper than Apple store so I thought I was getting good deal, NOT"
2100,1.0," First of all, sound is really bad, there is static in the background and I’m hearing an echo of some unknown music (not what I’m listening)"
2101,1.0, Last drop was battery life
2102,1.0, First time it happened I thought that my daughter might have used my AirPods and drained my battery
2103,1.0," This time I fully charged them, charging station and AirPods were 100% charged"
2104,1.0," I placed them in my purse where they will be safe, and not borrowed by teenager"
2105,1.0," They were sitting in my purse for 4-5 days, not being used at all so they should be fully charged"
2106,1.0," Well the light was green for a few seconds, then it changed to orange"
2107,1.0, Pods were not connecting to my phone even though I tried to connect them by holding button in the back of charging station
2108,1.0," I even tried to forget device on my phone, then reconnect, but at that point orange light on the charging station disappeared, and that happens only if they are completely drained, dead"
2109,1.0, Today they will be going back to Amazon
2110,1.0," I don’t want another pair, I want full refund, and I’ll be buying a new pair from good old Apple store"
2111,1.0,I am extremely angry about this purchase
2112,1.0, I anxiously awaited this package as I accidentally washed and dried my son's air pods
2113,1.0, The package finally arrives (1 week after ordered Amazon Prime) and the only thing in the box was a charging cable
2114,1.0, No air pods at all
2115,1.0," Are you kidding me, Amazon"
2116,1.0, Either you have a thief working for you or you think you can rob me
2117,1.0, The box was torn on one end
2118,1.0, I was okay with that but then I opened it and it was empty cardboard inside with a charging cord underneath
2119,1.0, I didn't even order a charging cord
2120,1.0, I could not be madder
2121,1.0," I would give it a negative 1,0000000000000000 stars"
2122,1.0,"I opened them and thought “Oh no, the charging case is missing and realized that they’re wired"
2123,1.0, All the the pictures and reviews on the selling page are of wireless AirPods
2124,1.0, The box looks like wireless AirPods but they’re wired
2125,1.0, The ad says AirPods with wired charging case
2126,1.0, wired AirPods don’t have a charging case at all so even though the title said wired everything else about the ad and the description is more wireless AirPods
2127,1.0, I feel extremely misled
2128,1.0, The ad even talks about battery life and talk time which doesn’t even apply to a wired set of AirPods
2129,3.0,First the good- sound quality and ease of use are amazing
2130,3.0," Yes, this was a genuine Apple product, I verified the serial number before I opened the box"
2131,3.0," They connected to my phone right away, no weird extra steps to pair"
2132,3.0, They sound amazing
2133,3.0, They are not noise canceling- I thought that wouldn’t be as big of a deal as it is
2134,3.0, Now for the reason I’m upgrading to the pro model- the fit is awful
2135,3.0, The right AirPod hurts my ear after only a few minutes of use
2136,3.0, The pro model has more fit options and noise cancellation
2137,3.0," I am glad that I tried these because they are by far the easiest Bluetooth ear buds I’ve ever used, the sound is great, and if they fit better I’d be 100% sold"
2138,3.0, So there you go
2139,3.0," Give them a try for sure, but once you do, you may want the better set"
2140,3.0, And GET APPLE CARE
2141,3.0, I work on the repair side of things and we send them out all the time
2142,3.0, I would not think to get these without the added protection
2143,2.0,I have problems with the Audio becoming desynced and some annoying issues with old firmware
2144,2.0, There was also a rather nasty bug with the model I received
2145,2.0, It nearly made me deaf - if you don't know to update the thing (which is a problem for Android
2146,2.0,) then you might suffer some hearing damage
2147,2.0, I used them for days with the bug and was on the cusp of returning them
2148,2.0," The bug is that the audio defaults to maximum volume - with any device (iOS, Android, etc) - until the software is updated"
2149,2.0, This volume setting reverts to maximum everytime the device enters a power saving state
2150,2.0, They sleep aggressive (like maybe 5 seconds of silence)
2151,2.0," So, if you're streaming music and it takes more than 5 seconds to fetch the next song -- you're getting blasted at full volume force from a device directly inserted into your ear"
2152,2.0, Very painful
2153,2.0," Again, if you just update them they're fine"
2154,2.0, I was able to reproduce the problem on multiple devices and it wasnt until I updated my airpods that the problem went away
2155,2.0, Now the only problem I have is the occasional desync of audio
2156,2.0, It's easily fixed and a lot of other people have the same issue sadly
2157,2.0," I have noticed that holding the phone differently affects the rate at which desync occurs, so probably just something with signaling"
2158,2.0, Leaving the phone flat and uncovered/held remedies my issue
2159,2.0," When they work, they're really nice"
2160,2.0, But overall the initial frustrations really took it's toll on my ability to like this product
2161,2.0, Hopefully there's better QA on the next generation
2162,5.0,I have always considered AirPods a waste of money until I actually got them
2163,5.0," I got a new job of course where you can’t listen to music so I got these to hide the fact I was listening to music because basically you have to wait your turn to bag groceries for 10-30 minutes depending how busy it is and just stare at the customers and look around and wait your turn, and having these makes the day a lot better"
2164,5.0, Also I go on lots of family road trips and earbud cords get in the way when your eating or doing something but these AirPods are so easy to use and there’s no cords to bother you
2165,5.0, And when you need to charge them and your on the road you don’t need to fight to charge something because if the case is fully charged it can charge the AirPods from dead battery to 100% in like 15 minutes and then when you get to a hotel you can charge your phone and AirPods for the next day
2166,5.0," And a charger comes with these too so I recommend getting a wall charger with two usb plug ins so you can charge your AirPods and iPhone at the same time, and charge everything at once"
2167,3.0,I am comparing these to my ~$40 SoundPEATs Q29 model i bought 2-3 years ago
2168,3.0, Its almost as the the pros and cons for these two competing earbuds are reversed
2169,3.0,Apple AirPod PROS:
2170,3.0,Battery Life: ~5 hrs listening time
2171,3.0," And the case holds charge for, i don't even know how many charges"
2172,3.0, I haven't counted but its significantly higher than the SoundPEATS
2173,3.0,Ease of Charging: SO SIMPLE
2174,3.0, The magnet inside secures the airpods to the charging electrodes
2175,3.0, The soundpeats lose their connection to the electrodes constantly so it never fully charges either earbud
2176,3.0, I would have to constantly twerk and manipulate the buds in the case to make them charge
2177,3.0,Ease of Connecting: The chip helps them connect without any problems
2178,3.0,Audio Latency while watching video: NONE
2179,3.0,Custimization: Really like that you can customize the controls for either right or left AirPod
2180,3.0," However, would like, more gestures I'd like to customize"
2181,3.0," Like, instead of just a 2 tap, also have a 3-tap"
2182,3.0, That way you can customize 4 controls
2183,3.0," I'd really like to be able to repeat a song, or turn up and down the volume"
2184,3.0,Apple AirPod MEHS:
2185,3.0,Audio Quality: Just a little better than the SoundPEATs
2186,3.0, not much but it is noticeable
2187,3.0,Apple AirPod CONS:
2188,3.0,"Connectivity: Because of the Apple's forced upgrading, we can't use these on devices running anything before iOS10"
2189,3.0, That means I can't connect to my First Gen iPad
2190,3.0," (the thing is still chugging along and great for streaming NetFlix, Hulu, and Videos"
2191,3.0,Comfort: The SoundPEATs were super comfortable and fit snuggly in the ear
2192,3.0, The shape of the AirPods bothers my earholes
2193,3.0, I even purchased some vinyl condoms with earplugs to cover it up
2194,3.0," It makes it more comfortable, but its still noticeably more uncomfortable"
2195,3.0," Also, those vinyl covers don't allow the AirPods to fit in the case, so I have to remove them all the time"
2196,3.0, which isn't too bad since I ended having to do that with the SoundPEATS because I couldn't get them to charge properly with the earbud cushion
2197,3.0, on
2198,3.0,Look/Style: The AirPods look dumb as hell
2199,3.0, The SoundPEATs are small and round and fit right in the ear and don't have a white wang hanging down over your earlobe
2200,3.0,Dropped Connection/Choppy Audio: Ok
2201,3.0, Here I was thinking that the AirPods would correct this issue with the SoundPEATs
2202,3.0," When I'm oustide working in the yard, audio was choppy regardless if the phone was 10 feet away or in my pocket"
2203,3.0, Nothing I did seemed to correct it
2204,3.0, It was like this with the SoundPEATS
2205,3.0, I THOUGHT that the chip in the AirPods would keep this from happening
2206,3.0, NOPE
2207,3.0, SAME PROBLEM PERSISTED and was made worse by the fact that they were 3
2208,3.0,5x more expensive
2209,3.0, Work fine in doors and while I'm at work in the lab
2210,3.0, Must be some sort of interference outside
2211,3.0," But really, Come on"
2212,3.0, Its 2019
2213,3.0, GET IT TOGETHER
2214,3.0,Exterior Audio: UGH The AirPods fail spectacularly here
2215,3.0," Not only do they get choppy while I'm out doing yard work, but because they don't have a rubber tip that seals up the ear canal like the SoundPEATs, that means I get to hear the FULL sound of my lawnmower and weedwacker and it drowns out my jams"
2216,3.0, And also my nagging boss at work and rando plebians i come across in my travels
2217,3.0, Also this means they will be practically useless on an airplane
2218,3.0," The SoundPEATs helped block out the engine drone and crying and shouting babies, children, and MAGA douchenozzles"
2219,3.0,"Overall, I like them enough to keep using them for regular use but I will need to go back to my SoundPeats for airplane travel and yardwork"
2220,3.0, Son of a
2221,1.0,I ordered a pair of use AirPods because they come from the Amazon warehouse and should be properly checked before being shipped out
2222,1.0, Unfortunately mine never worked as a result of the AirPods inside the case not belonging to the case and being defective
2223,1.0, Such a waste of time and money
2224,1.0,"These airpods are light, comfortable and generally produced and received well for calls"
2225,1.0," Overall though, I would not recommend for Android phones (despite what other reviews tell you)"
2226,1.0,I'd searched ahead of time and plenty of Android-phone users seemed to have good experiences despite this being an Apple product (which obviously works better with other Apple products)
2227,1.0," I wanted to try them because of the lightweight comfortable fit that many people had raved about, long battery life, as well as the tap functions"
2228,1.0," I didn't realize how annoying the bugs for Android would be though, even after forcing a firmware update the main issues consistently recur:"
2229,1.0,1
2230,1.0," Slipping out of sync (between left and right, sometimes more and more out of sync, if I don't pause and replay, or unsync and re-pair)"
2231,1.0,2
2232,1.0," Audio cut-outs - usually not if you have uninterrupted line-of-sight, but if my phone is in my pocket or bag, then it was guaranteed to cut out"
2233,1.0,"Between backorder delay, and delay to return due to trying to troubleshoot the issues with re-pairing and firmware updating, I'm unable to do a return now :("
2234,1.0,"I received a well-used item, not new"
2235,3.0,"It’s exactly what you asked for, Air-pods"
2236,3.0, Everything is good the noise canceling is trash along with volume compared to any traditional headphones
2237,3.0, The battery life is good for being so light and small
2238,3.0, The sound quality is affected by the lack of noise cancelation
2239,3.0,Update after a month or 2 owning these
2240,3.0," A lot of people say that I sound like I’m far away, or muffled"
2241,3.0, It happens ALOT
2242,3.0," Barely ANY bass, if non at all"
2243,3.0, Pretty uncomfortable in the ears too over an extended period of time
2244,3.0, It is what it is
2245,5.0,I purchased these after having to return the AirPods Pro
2246,5.0, I have small ears and I am one of the few people who can't wear the AirPods pro without discomfort and without them falling out of my ears
2247,5.0," So, very sadly, I had to return those and ""settle"" for these"
2248,5.0, I feel very happy with these
2249,5.0," The sound is fine, obviously not as good as the Pro's, and they don't have noise cancellation (which was nice)"
2250,5.0, But Apple has a very solid product here
2251,5.0," These DO stay in my ears, and are not uncomfortable"
2252,5.0, I like how they automatically pair with my Apple devices
2253,5.0," Unfortunately, I cannot get them to pair with my work issued laptop"
2254,5.0," Also, although I did get them to pair with my Dell personal laptop, I cannot adjust the volume no matter what I try, and I'm not the only one with the issue"
2255,5.0,I googled it and lots of people are trying to resolve this issue
2256,5.0," It will literally deafen me, so I cannot use the with my laptop, which is disappointing"
2257,5.0," It seems to be a problem with the Dell Inspiron version, and maybe not Apple"
2258,5.0," Either way, will not work satisfactorily"
2259,5.0," I do use them with my Apple watch, and i love them for that"
2260,5.0," Overall, pretty happy"
2261,4.0,"I wanted wireless headphones mostly for running, but also to use casually for conference calls and listening to music/podcasts"
2262,4.0, From the outset I assumed the Powerbeats would be the best for me and got those
2263,4.0," While they are very good, it didn't blow me away"
2264,4.0, It wasn't so much better than the $30 bluetooth headphones I got 3 years ago
2265,4.0, I also struggled to get a good fit in my one ear
2266,4.0," What made me send it back though, was that it is just too bulky"
2267,4.0," The carrying case is huge and even the earphones without the case are big, and I didn't just want to put them in my denim pockets, as they have protrusions that might get damaged or break off"
2268,4.0," Bottom line, you can't just keep them in your pockets ""just in case"""
2269,4.0, Every time you want to take it somewhere you have to make space for it somewhere
2270,4.0,So I got the Airpods
2271,4.0, I was very skeptical that:
2272,4.0,1
2273,4.0, They would fall out when running
2274,4.0,2
2275,4.0, They would not survive the sweat I generate in the Atlanta summer during 13 miles jogs
2276,4.0,I watched some YouTube videos testing their water tolerance and I was surprised that people reported them fully functional after a wash/dry cycle (obviously not recommended)
2277,4.0, I pulled the trigger and bought it and am happy to report that they work perfectly for running
2278,4.0," The sounds is good (not quite as great as the Powerbeats), and they don't fall out at all while running"
2279,4.0," I thought I'd might need an after market silicone casing or ear hook, but found I didn't need it"
2280,4.0,The main reason I removed 1 star is because they are very slippery
2281,4.0," Even when the Airpods and your hands are dry, it's slippery and prone to falling when taking it out"
2282,4.0," When the Airpods and your hands are both wet and slippery, they become like a wet piece of soap, almost impossible to handle"
2283,4.0, Apple should make it a bit more grippy
2284,4.0,"Overall, great product and what really sealed the deal is the portability and the fact that I can carry the Airpods on me all the time"
2285,1.0,How is it possible that this product gets all the accolades about how great it is with the iPhone
2286,1.0, The connectivity is the absolute worst of any bluetooth I've ever owned
2287,1.0," I can be in the middle of a conversation and it disconnects, then connects back, then drops my call"
2288,1.0, This has happened over and over again
2289,1.0," When I call Apple, they tell me to do the same remedies and still they do not work"
2290,1.0, I will be returning these this week and going back to the Plantronics Legend that is far more reliable
2291,1.0, DO NOT BUY
2292,3.0,I bought the Airpods new
2293,3.0, they work great for listing to music and phone calls
2294,3.0," However, about 9 months in the mic on both airpods have a defect where the caller can barly hear you, or voice recordings using the airpods is very low"
2295,3.0, Being out of warranty at 9 months the only option is customer paid replacement
2296,3.0," After checking the support pages, there are quite a few people reporting the same issue with Airpods"
2297,3.0," Buying AppleCare for the AirPods at $30 sounds good, but it cost $30 per incident for repair/replacements"
2298,3.0, In this case it would cost $60 to get two replacement Airpods
2299,3.0," $60 for the airpods and $30 for the AppleCare puts it at another $90 for a new pair, when a new pair costs $130"
2300,3.0," Even though the warrenty is for 3 years, it only covers 2 incidents"
2301,3.0,and replacing both for the mic issue is 2 incidence
2302,3.0, So the 3 year warranty endes at 9 months to get the mic fix
2303,3.0,which allows for maybe 2 years of service
2304,3.0,"Apple needs a recall program for this issue, because $130-$170 for AirPods what will fail at 9 months is a problem"
2305,3.0,I was hesitant to purchase Airpods because of the steep price so when I saw there was a deal a few months ago (early 2020) I hopped on the bandwagon
2306,3.0," Since I have many Apple products, these DO make it easier to sync up to my Macbook, iPhone and iPad"
2307,3.0," However, even with that being the case the airpods I received were defective"
2308,3.0, I spent hours talking to customer service and at the Apple Store (pre-COVID) and they ended up having to replace the case and one of the airpods
2309,3.0, At times I still have issues with connectivity and the microphone isn't the greatest
2310,3.0, Sometimes my airpods would be in the case and I wasn't trying to connect to my phone yet the music would play WHILE THEY WERE IN THE CASE
2311,3.0, I even reported this to the apple care team and my customer service representative told me it was something they'd never seen or heard about before
2312,3.0," (Seriously wish I was making this up, I just wanted to be able to have wireless earbuds)"
2313,3.0,"I'll admit that I don't fully regret my purchase, but regret buying it via Amazon instead of from the Apple Store or a major retailer (i"
2314,3.0,e
2315,3.0, Best Buy)
2316,3.0," Not sure if my logic makes sense, but I feel like there would've have been less of a chance of getting a faulty item"
2317,3.0,"TLR; Airpods aren't a bad investment, but be wary and monitor your item if you buy it via Amazon"
2318,3.0, ALSO they aren't noise cancelling and the microphone isn't the greatest
2319,3.0," The sound is OK but if you want to still spend a good amount of money, you probably can get better quality headphones elsewhere"
2320,3.0," The best feature to me is that it is super connected with my apple products and I can tap to change the songs, etc"
2321,1.0,Been a musician for 30 years without one issue with my ears
2322,1.0, Wore these pieces of crap for two weeks and now I can’t get the ringing out of my ears for over a month now
2323,1.0, Went to my doctor to determine that my left ear may now be permanently damaged
2324,1.0, I primarily took phone calls for work with these things
2325,1.0,"Word of advise, don’t buy these things if you value your hearing"
2326,1.0, Apple don’t give a crap about you and wouldn’t be the first time some company released a product that harms the public
2327,1.0,Approximately 80 % of time these ear pods chime when placed in ears and the clarity in sound couldn't be better
2328,1.0, Unfortunately one never knows when the 20% of nothing will kick in
2329,1.0," This week I've had five consecutive evenings when preparing to listen to my book in bed, I discovered no chime nor connection"
2330,1.0, I called the support phone number and waited too long
2331,1.0," I went onto CHAT with quick response and willing person to help, but I couldn't understand her"
2332,1.0," Thirty minutes later, she decided to put me through to higher authority"
2333,1.0, I went on hold and met another person I couldn't understand
2334,1.0, That person couldn't understand me
2335,1.0, I don't want these ear pods
2336,1.0, My daughter has the same ones without problems
2337,1.0, Mine have problems
2338,1.0, I want a refund
2339,1.0, It's not offered
2340,1.0,It’s a pain to get Apple service if you bought these through Amazon and bumped into problems like I did
2341,1.0,So I purchased these on Prime Day (10/13)
2342,1.0, As soon as 10/17 the left pod started having problems
2343,1.0, It didn’t hold charge even was left overnight
2344,1.0," Called Amazon support, was told to contact Apple directly"
2345,1.0,"Long story short, Apple first suggested to send me replacement for left pod and put a hold on my card of $73"
2346,1.0,83 for non-return fee (in case I didn’t return the defected AirPod) — reasonable
2347,1.0," Then I received the new left pod, Apple didn’t include the return label and just told me to discard the defected pod — which meant I just bought a brand new left pod and WTF"
2348,1.0,"Apple explained that since I didn’t buy these AirPods directly from them, the limited warranty didn’t apply to my purchase"
2349,1.0, Woaaaa
2350,1.0,Amazon didn’t make AirPods right folks
2351,1.0,"After a week of frustration calling Apple to follow up (while using the defected pod, I didn’t wanna break the seal of the new pod unless I knew exactly how this issue gonna land), Apple agreed to reserve the charge on my credit card for the stupid replacement"
2352,1.0,Amazon Associate was nice enough to follow up w me about this case
2353,1.0, But the contract whatsoever between Amazon and Apple was a mess and their customers were the one who suffered
2354,5.0,I love being able to throw these things in my pocket
2355,5.0," I felt they looked a little goofy at first, but I got over that"
2356,5.0," They don't advertise these ones as noise cancelling, but I swear they do cancel out some of the outside noise, and I don't think that's just in my head, either"
2357,5.0," They aren't cheap, but I have a pair of these and a pair of Beats Studio Earphones, and that way I can go either way, which usually means I use the AirPods for walks, or going out, and the Earphones are for the beach, or at home (is it just me or is it just a little scary being basically deaf to the world around you at times"
2358,5.0,)
2359,5.0,"I think they ought to include these with the purchase of the expensive phones that Apple sells, but that's just me"
2360,5.0,"One last thing-supposedly the newer generation are more sweat resistant than these ones, but I haven't had any issues there, so I'm not sure what that's all about"
2361,5.0," It's not like I'm a marathon runner, but I have worn these in the summer on long walks, and besides cleaning them with a q-tip here and there, there's no issues"
2362,5.0,"The battery life is about 2 hours, maybe a hair less than that, but if you just bring the case with you, you put them back in there and about 15-20 minutes later they're charged again"
2363,5.0," The case itself needs to be charged every so often, which roughly translates to every 2-3 days, or every 3 charges"
2364,5.0," They last a long time if they're just sitting in the drawer, not on the charger, which makes them available to use pretty much at all times"
2365,5.0," As the corny cliche goes, I don't leave home without them"
2366,1.0,I own 2nd generation and bought for my BF as a gift
2367,1.0, However when he opened the box and went to charge he looked at me after they were plugged and said
2368,1.0, How do I know they are charging
2369,1.0, I looked at him like he was crazy
2370,1.0, Then I realized they were completely different from mine
2371,1.0, 2nd gens DO NOT have silver on the front like the ones we got
2372,1.0, Also the charging light was inside
2373,1.0, I know they're first gen but IDK if they are first gen knock offs
2374,1.0, Box looked iffy
2375,1.0, We were returning anyways so no need to look up serial number
2376,3.0,"So these would have been perfect, if only they fit my ears"
2377,3.0," The sound quality is pretty good, they connect so easily, they charge fast and last a while, they even stayed in my ears pretty well, but for me they are painful to wear"
2378,3.0," This shouldn’t have surprised me because I remember my first pair of apple wired EarPods when they changed the design, those literally made my ears blister and bleed"
2379,3.0, These fit exactly the same
2380,3.0," Many people love that fit, though"
2381,3.0," If you’ve historically liked the pod design, these will likely be great for you"
2382,3.0," If you’re hoping for something different, go pro or another brand"
2383,3.0, I’m gifting to a family member who loves their wired earbuds and I think he’ll love these
2384,3.0," I upgraded myself to the pros with the customizable fit, way better for me personally"
2385,3.0,This is design to work with iphone macbook etc
2386,3.0, After all Apple desgin their product to work best with their product
2387,3.0, It can work with android phone just like a regular bluetooth device but you will lose those features that are unique to apple
2388,3.0, And you will be better off buying those generic bluetooth that is much cheaper
2389,3.0," Indeed, I do not feel any sound difference between Airpods 2 and those I bought off street"
2390,3.0," But, if music quality is something you want + noise cancellation feature, go for airpod pro which now I feel it is more worthy"
2391,3.0," However, 2 main problem with me is that 1"
2392,3.0," even though I have iphones and macbook, I don't wear headphones so it's a waste to spend on such expensive gadget 2"
2393,3.0," my friends who reccoomend this to me about how ""they sleep without feelign its in ears"" but it doesn't work"
2394,3.0," I feel strange wearing them, I can definitely feel I am wearing headphone, and the left ear one keeps falling out of my ear on its own"
2395,3.0," I was sitting and watching movies, not even moving at all and it slip out every 60s"
2396,3.0, So 
2397,3.0, I will say ear type matters too
2398,3.0," If air pods isn't for you and you really want apple, go for the pro"
2399,5.0,I love these Airpods
2400,5.0, I like that they're easy to use
2401,5.0," If you take one pod out, it automatically pauses the music which is really cool"
2402,5.0, They automatically connect when you put them in your ear and automatically disconnect when you put them in the case
2403,5.0," easy to charge, same charger cord as the iPhone uses"
2404,5.0, I didn't want to get any earphones with that rubbery material because I feel like that is too difficult to clean and it catches more germs
2405,5.0, So I prefer the plastic-y material ear phones
2406,5.0, The sound is good quality
2407,5.0," For me, it was worth the money"
2408,5.0," I tried quite a few off-brand, cheaper, wireless earnphones, but they were all crap"
2409,5.0, Airpods are the real deal
2410,1.0,These were ordered October of 2020 for a Christmas gift for my daughter
2411,1.0, The right one quit working
2412,1.0, Of course apple wasn’t too helpful and I basically sent them back only to have them send them back with the same issue
2413,1.0, I will be calling and demanding a replacement pair or a refund
2414,1.0, Be ready Apple
2415,1.0, A contract works both ways
2416,1.0, Service works both ways
2417,1.0, You failed on your end of the bargain
2418,5.0,Ok these are my first time having an airpods and I did some research of how telling if you get fake or real
2419,5.0, The only way to know they are real once you connect to them and your name pops up when you connect and you see all the setting for the airpods and you see about the airpods
2420,5.0, Fake if you don't see the all the setting
2421,5.0, So the AirPods 2nd generation are real
2422,5.0, I highly recommend buying this
2423,5.0,"I had a pair of SENSO Bluetooth headphones and they had served me well and after a couple of years I wanted to go wireless, since the wire between each earpiece was bothersome, but I didn’t want to spend a lot for the gym and was worried about the fit with Apples AirPods"
2424,5.0, The price drop on the Apple AirPods was too good to pass up and I upgraded
2425,5.0, My concern about the fit and them not fitting and possible falling out while exercising and out for a run we’re quickly dismissed
2426,5.0," They fit very good, stay in place deliver excellent sound and the battery life is excellent also"
2427,5.0, The charge quickly and I went with the wired charging since I still use the Apple lightning cord on my phone and would use that charger
2428,5.0," These were a great trade up and I am very p,eased with the Apple AirPods"
2429,5.0," The AirPods themselves offer many features including Siri, and other options but too much to write up, if your interested read the “about this item” notes in Amazon’s page"
2430,4.0,I'm cheap
2431,4.0, This was in large part why I resisted shelling out the money for these
2432,4.0," Consequently, I tried several other Bluetooth earbuds, several on the decidedly cheap end of the scale"
2433,4.0, One of the problems I experience is finding earbuds that fit my ears
2434,4.0," I have very small ear canals, so the earbuds that have the cone shape tip that fits into the ear canal either just won't fit, or are extremely painful after a short time"
2435,4.0," The only shape I've found that actually works for me are these, which I discovered with the first pair of wired Apple earbuds that came with a new iPhone several versions back"
2436,4.0,"I included this picture, which shows the Airpods on the left and the much cheaper knock-off I tried"
2437,4.0," I thought I'd be okay with the shape of the cheap ones, but as you can see, they are actually much larger than the Airpods, so they were frequently falling out of my ears, especially when I was doing any physical activity"
2438,4.0,"So, I bit the bullet and shelled out for the OGs"
2439,4.0, Here's my take:
2440,4.0,Pros:
2441,4.0,-Integration with other Apple products
2442,4.0," I have an iPhone, iPad and Apple watch and these work quite seamlessly unlike any others I've tried"
2443,4.0," I put ""almost"" in the title because I'm sure it will be improved on in further versions, I'm just not sure how"
2444,4.0," Oh, and I've never used ""Hey Siri"" as much as I do with these"
2445,4.0, I love being able to adjust the volume (among other commands) hands free
2446,4.0," True story: Yesterday I was riding a scooter home from work, and not wanting to remove either hand from the handlebars, I wanted to use Siri to increase the volume"
2447,4.0," There was enough ambient downtown noise that Siri was having trouble hearing me, so as I was tootling down the busy city street I was saying ""Hey Siri"" repeatedly at increasing volume, until I was shouting it"
2448,4.0, Not one of my finer moments
2449,4.0,-The fit (see above)
2450,4.0,-Quick charging
2451,4.0," I will have something to say about the battery life in Cons, but one saving grace is that they charge remarkably fast"
2452,4.0," I do a lot of work from my computer (like a lot of others during the time of COVID), so I appreciate being able to get a quick charge on them between meetings"
2453,4.0,-Sound quality
2454,4.0," I am not an audiophile, so my opinion here is very pedestrian, but they seem to have a good dynamic range"
2455,4.0, I've been blown away by the bass response coming out of such a small thing
2456,4.0,Cons:
2457,4.0,-They still are not very secure in my ears
2458,4.0," I suppose that could be more my issue than the Airpods, but I did have to buy an aftermarket accessory kit that included the silicone tips with wings and a silicone lanyard"
2459,4.0," Sometimes I commute to work on an electric scooter, and if it weren't for those (particularly the lanyard) I would have dropped one of them in the street multiple times"
2460,4.0, Sometimes I walk over a grate in the street and have a brief moment of fear that one will pop out of my ear and through the grate
2461,4.0," With my luck, it isn't so much an issue of ""if"", but ""when"""
2462,4.0," (Side Note: if Apple doesn't sell replacements individually, they should)"
2463,4.0,-Battery life
2464,4.0," I figure I get about 2 hours of active use, which is fine and I think what they advertise"
2465,4.0, The curious thing is that the two discharge at very different rates
2466,4.0," I'm trying to keep track so I can take them into our local Apple store and ask about it, but it is odd, and I have seen other reviews that also noted that issue"
2467,4.0,"Overall, I give them 2 thumbs up"
2468,5.0,I picked these up at a slight discount
2469,5.0, I've been curious about AirPods for years now
2470,5.0," I was always discouraged by the steep price and so for the longest time, i settled for ""budget earbuds"""
2471,5.0, My AirPods (second generation) arrived today and I don't typically rush onto Amazon to write a review but these things are spectacular
2472,5.0," I love the Siri integration, the customizable double tap feature, the crisp and clear audio when listening to everything from music to podcasts"
2473,5.0,even the charging case is a sleek looking device
2474,5.0," Pairing your Airpods to your iPhone, iPad, or any bluetooth device really, is a total breeze (but most especially when it comes to other iOS devices"
2475,5.0,"I've purchased 3 different knockoffs, and each one was terrible"
2476,5.0," I ""bit the bullet"", spent the mega amount of money for the ""cadillac"" brand, and am satisfied with the generation one airpods"
2477,5.0," Unlike the knockoffs, these earbuds don't drop connection, and stay synced with one another"
2478,5.0," If you're like me, and are hesitant because of the amount of money the apple brand cost, you'll get more for your money buying the official brand"
2479,5.0," I've spent the same amount collectively on the three other ""airpods"" being $130 instead of buying these in the first place"
2480,5.0," Now, if we're to look at it like this, in the end I've spent $260 😥 I would include a picture of the airpods, but anyone reading this can just as easily google image search 'apple airpods generation one"""
2481,5.0, What I received is exactly as described
2482,5.0, When i tell you i couldn’t wait for my EarPods to come i couldn’t wait i ordered them Friday and they came next day afternoon they are AMAZING I LOVEEEEE EM
2483,5.0," I’m a person that’s big on sound and they sound amazing, They really block out any noises around and if you’re listening to music n you take one pod out the ear it automatically pauses you also can have the option of getting your messages read out loud in the pods"
2484,5.0, I Love them Great Purchase like everything else i order from Amazon👍🏻
2485,5.0,Day 2 of my WFH experience I realized I needed wireless audio capability to be more effective on video and audio teleconferences
2486,5.0," With meetings usually lasting one hour, and my schedule often having back-to-back meetings, it would be nice if the battery life were a little longer than the 3 hours"
2487,5.0," However, understanding that batteries add weight, and current technology is what it is, I'll go with bluetooth airpods any day"
2488,5.0, Just remember to park them in the recharger module between meetings so you don't have to switch to wired audio
2489,5.0," These also work well when you're WFH with a significant other and you both need your own professional space, even if in an apartment"
2490,3.0,"My little 7 year old nephew wanted the first generation airpod for his birthday but his parents thought they were a waste of money, so I got them for him behind his parents' backs and he loves them"
2491,3.0,They operated well until approximately a month ago
2492,3.0," At that point, the right earbud microphone started to malfunction and would no longer detect sound until he yelled"
2493,3.0," I phoned Apple customer service and went over all of the possible remedies, such as upgrading to the most recent iOS and checking that the AirPods were running the most recent firmware"
2494,3.0," When customer service was unable to remedy the issue, they advised me to send the AirPods in for repair"
2495,3.0, I received a FedEx shipment box and label and made them an offer for repair
2496,3.0," The AirPods were returned to me approximately three days later, along with a message from the technicians claiming that there was nothing wrong with them"
2497,3.0,"I then tested them on my phone and my wife's phone, and the right microphone on both phones would only detect sound at a very high volume, but the sound was still garbled"
2498,3.0, I phoned Apple's customer service department once more
2499,3.0, The representative advised that I take the AirPods to the local Apple Store and explain the problem to a professional there
2500,3.0," Unfortunately, the nearest Apple Store was an hour away from my house, however the agent did not appear to find this to be an issue"
2501,3.0,"I expressed my unhappiness with having to drive 2 hours round trip to fix a $130 equipment, and I inquired as to why I couldn't send them back for repair while determining the specific problem"
2502,3.0, The agent agreed to send another shipping box and note that the problem was with the right microphone on the repair ticket
2503,3.0," I got another package, sent the AirPods in for repair a second time, and waited"
2504,3.0, They gave them back to me and said there was nothing wrong with them
2505,3.0," And, once again, the right microphone isn't working properly"
2506,3.0,"At this point, I'm left wondering why the ""World's Most Valuable Company"" would consider it appropriate to force a client to spend 3 hours of my time repairing Apple's product rather than just shipping a new pair and keeping the consumer satisfied"
2507,3.0, Apple's customer service has tarnished what might have been a fantastic device
2508,4.0,Pros n Cons
2509,4.0,Pros
2510,4.0,Great battery life ( over 4 and a half hours average)
2511,4.0,When pods are almost out if power it gives a decending musical notation ( unlike others that scream BATTERY LOW in your ear while trying to go to sleep)
2512,4.0,Battery case gives two full charges before IT needs to recharge
2513,4.0,Fits nicely in ear canal
2514,4.0,Good sound quality
2515,4.0,Cons
2516,4.0,( getting picky here)
2517,4.0,Programming turns off when removing pod from ear ( ok
2518,4.0,that's a plus)
2519,4.0, But it doesn't resume the program when replacing the pod
2520,4.0, You must manually hit the start button again
2521,4.0,Also when listening to a podcast and you wish to switch to another you cannot just push the button on the newly decided upon program
2522,4.0, You must shut down the previous show and then pick the new one
2523,4.0,( I told you this was picky
2524,4.0,didn't I)
2525,4.0,Otherwise a great product that outshines any knockoffs
2526,4.0," These are more expensive, but more enjoyable than buying eight cheapo lookalikes and getting frustrated at the inferiority"
2527,4.0,Great quality here and well worth it
2528,4.0,I ordered these and a pair of Bultone ear buds in the same month
2529,4.0," These are one of the best purchases I have ever made in terms of convenience, lifestyle enhancement, and general happiness"
2530,4.0,Pros:
2531,4.0,1
2532,4.0," sound quality - perfect for music - great, even tone and quality bass, reliable never any static or wonky pitches"
2533,4.0,2
2534,4.0, Bluetooth connection - só reliable and easy to connect
2535,4.0, Once paired with a device it’s seamless; just pop them in your ears
2536,4.0, Can stray a pretty good distance from your device and still have good reception
2537,4.0,3
2538,4.0, Call quality & Siri - call quality is awesome and works without the other party even noticing I’m on Bluetooth
2539,4.0, Have used them for both business and personal calls in the car and at home for hour long conferences as well as quick hit calls
2540,4.0, Never had a problem with people hearing me or hearing the other parties
2541,4.0, Really love that Siri announces notifications when I’m using them
2542,4.0,4
2543,4.0, Personalization - Love that you can tweak the controls to your own preferences
2544,4.0,Cons
2545,4.0,Charging - While charging the ear buds is super fast and easy I will say that the charging case doesn’t seem to hold a charge as long as the Bultone case does
2546,4.0, The buds themselves also don’t hold a charge as long as my Bultone buds do
2547,4.0,Fit - I have very small ears and these are comfortable but they fall out occasionally
2548,4.0, I am not comfortable wearing them out and about in public after having lost one on several occasions when it just spontaneously popped out of my ear
2549,4.0,Price - would be nice if these were closer to the 99
2550,4.0,00 price point
2551,4.0, Just feel the 150
2552,4.0,00 price range they hover in is a tad high but I would buy them again for sure
2553,5.0,"Apple airpods were delivered a little later than the prime usual, but understandably so due to the pre-Christmas rush"
2554,5.0, They perform well and the sound is good
2555,5.0, The only two considerations are that they don’t fit perfectly into my ear canals as each one is a bit differently shaped
2556,5.0, Consequently the noise reduction and the sound quality would be better if they fit more snugly
2557,5.0, That being said the Wi-Fi works seamlessly and is greatly improved over the directly wired EarPods I initially received with my Apple X plus phone
2558,5.0, The other consideration is that they only hold a charge somewhere between four and five hours
2559,5.0," So when I was out Christmas shopping all day one day, the audio faded out after four hours in one year and about 4 1/2 and the other"
2560,5.0, But I was grateful for those hours
2561,5.0, So if these air buds remain functional for a year I may invest in the air Bud pros next Christmas
2562,5.0,These are COOL
2563,5.0, This is truly something I wish I'd purchased months ago
2564,5.0,"They are easy to set up, just flip open case and they connect"
2565,5.0, Not sure how long one charge lasts--haven't used them long term
2566,5.0," Seem pretty secure and mostly stay in place, but get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours"
2567,5.0, (I think they're a bit too big for my ears
2568,5.0,) Sound quality is wonderful
2569,5.0," I have hearing aids that are supposed to be able to allow me to listen to music and calls on my iPhone, but sound quality is awful, so I never used either feature"
2570,5.0," The first time I got an incoming call with these in place, I was surprised and pleased by how easy it was to fully understand the call without having to switch to speaker phone"
2571,5.0,I plan to try using my phone in meetings as a way of streaming other's voices directly into my ears
2572,5.0," I will be really nice to not miss half of what others say, or to get whiplash from turning my head back & forth to look at whomever is speaking as I try to read their lips"
2573,5.0, I understand that it's possible to put the phone in front of a TV and have it relay the sound directly to the Air Pods
2574,5.0," I currently don't need to do that because I can just pair them with the Roku app on my phone, but will try it out when visiting family to see if it will allow me to hear the TV better"
2575,5.0,They are exactly what I wanted/needed
2576,5.0, I Really like the version 2 AirPods as a replacement for my first ones
2577,5.0, (Didn’t want the newer ones with the pads that stick more into your ears
2578,5.0, my ears would not be happy
2579,5.0, Luckily I don’t have a problem with the original designed airpods falling out of my ears)
2580,5.0," NOTE: Batteries lasts longer, sound is good, has hands free hey seri, and still uses the lightning port to charge like all my other apple devices"
2581,5.0, I use them with either iPhone X Max Pro or Apple watch 4
2582,5.0, I don’t use them to listen to music
2583,5.0," I usually wear one in my left ear only to take:make phone calls, get notifications & directions, ask seri questions or give commands/get directions etc"
2584,5.0, 
2585,5.0, If the battery starts running low I put the right airpod in while the left one is charging
2586,5.0, Saved me $$$ also
2587,5.0, as using airpods prevents me from getting a traffic ticket as we can’t get caught using or looking at a phone while driving (even while stopped at a stoplight 
2588,5.0,)
2589,4.0,"Pros: they fit comfortably in my ear, the sound is clear and not muffled, and they sync instantly/ with my iPhone AND STAY CONNECTED AS LONG AS IT’S IN MY EAR"
2590,4.0," That is HUGE for me, and why I was willing to spend so much on these, considering how irritated I was with my old Bluetooth headset that kept disconnecting from my phone"
2591,4.0," I also LOVE the magnetic case they come in: it’s the perfect size to fit in my pocket or purse, taking up very little space but big enough that I haven’t managed to lose it yet"
2592,4.0," 🤣 the ear pieces are magnetically drawn into the case so they fit right every time, no chance for them to accidentally fall out or fail to charge, and the lid is magnetically closed, protecting the ear pieces"
2593,4.0," I also like that the charge for the case AND both ear pieces ALL show on my phone’s screen when it syncs, so I know when the case needs charging, as well"
2594,4.0," Last but not least, I like that I can wear one ear piece at a time, so I can swap sides as comfort/charge level dictates"
2595,4.0,"Cons: they are made from a very hard material, as expected based on stock photos, which makes these uncomfortable for me to wear long term"
2596,4.0," This is mitigated by the fact that I only need to wear one at a time, as mentioned previously, so I can swap back and forth between sides, as I need to"
2597,5.0,"I bought these because I do a lot of off-the-floor shifts at my work, which means I can listen to my music while I work"
2598,5.0," I figured these would be much more convenient for this, so I caved and bought the airpods"
2599,5.0," And I gotta say, even though I personally do not care much for Apple, these things are fantastic"
2600,5.0," The sound quality is nearly perfect, great bass capabilities too, and they are honestly almost as good as the headset I use for my computer (Which is a corsair)"
2601,5.0,My only gripe is with the battery life on them
2602,5.0, They die pretty quickly
2603,5.0, They didn't last a 5
2604,5.0,5-hour shift on at my work from a full charge when I started
2605,5.0," Granted, they charge very quickly with the case"
2606,5.0, Mine went from about 8% to 98% in 23 minutes (I did time the charge)
2607,5.0," They also appear to just drain even when not in use, not at a fast pace but still"
2608,5.0," So you'd have to keep them in the charging case when not in use and the case also needs to be charged as well, not that I wasn't expecting this side effect"
2609,5.0," Aside from this small inconvenience, I have not had any issues with these and I'm very impressed with the quality"
2610,5.0,"They also fit as expected, don't fall out super easily, and are able to be used for phone calls better than the default mic my phone has"
2611,5.0,"I must applaud Apple for this one, they did a great job"
2612,5.0, I highly recommend them and I have no doubt Apple will take advantage of the success and keep developing and improving them
2613,5.0,I’m very impressed
2614,5.0, The sound quality is actually extremely good with these 2nd Generation AirPods
2615,5.0, They also fit really well in my ears
2616,5.0, THEY ARE EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE
2617,5.0," You don’t even really feel them in your ears, and they don’t fall out either"
2618,5.0," I’ve heard that for some people the 3rd Gen AirPods are too big for their ears, but not these"
2619,5.0," They are a perfect size really, and they deliver excellent sound"
2620,4.0,I bought the pro version three months ago and accidentally tossed them (I was drying them with tissues) so I went for the cheapest replacement (Airpods 2)
2621,4.0, Here are my thoughts as to which one to choose
2622,4.0,"If this is the only listening device you have and you care about music quality, then buy Airpods Pro (noticeably superior music quality that falls far below earphones such as Sennheiser HD599; the quality is also below that of Boss QC35II)"
2623,4.0,"If you use this to listen to audiobooks, or if you have better earphones for music at home, by all means go for the regular Airpods"
2624,4.0, Why
2625,4.0, I personally find it far more comfortable
2626,4.0," The regular airpods are like the earbuds that come with Iphones -- while not the most comfortable, wearing them for two hours is not a big problem"
2627,4.0, I found the pro version extremely uncomfortable for more than an hour
2628,4.0," The noise cancellation is cool, very cool, but not essential for my usage"
2629,4.0,"If you travel frequently on domestic/short flights, then airpods pro might be great for its noise cancellation feature"
2630,4.0, But bear in mind Pro airpods are not the most comfortable
2631,4.0," Moreover, battery lasts about 5 hours so airpods won't be ideal for longhaul flights"
2632,4.0,"What I like about both: if you have lots of Apple devices, switching across these devices is very easy (2-3 clicks/taps)"
2633,4.0,"So for this regular version, I rate:"
2634,4.0,3/5 for music quality;
2635,4.0,4/5 for comfort;
2636,4.0,0 for noise cancellation
2637,1.0,If you’re looking for real ones please don’t get these ones
2638,1.0, They are fakes 
2639,1.0,I’m returning then and getting it from Apple
2640,1.0,Stopped working after only 9 months
2641,1.0, I bought these less than 1 year ago and up until 2 months ago they worked just fine
2642,1.0, The sound quality for listening to music is very unimpressive but I bought them to use for work while on virtual conference calls
2643,1.0, 2 months ago the left earbud stopped picking up my voice on calls or recognizing any other voice commands
2644,1.0, I tried several trouble shooting efforts to fix/reset but nothing worked
2645,1.0, I could still hear music in it but could not use it on calls
2646,1.0, So I started taking calls with just the right earbud
2647,1.0, Two weeks ago this earbud too only picked up my voice intermittently
2648,1.0, Finally today it stopped working too
2649,1.0," I now have an expensive pair of earbuds that cant be used on phone calls or recognize any voice commands, which is why I bought them in the first place"
2650,1.0, I am very disappointed in the crappy quality
2651,1.0, Apple lost a loyal customer on this one
2652,5.0,i bought this because i wanted to try a true wireless earphones for the first time
2653,5.0," i wanted to avoid it at first since everybody seems to have it, but it is undeniable that it is one of the best in the market right now so i bought it"
2654,5.0, its pretty amazing
2655,5.0, the sound quality is pretty good
2656,5.0, it has a total of 10 hours battery life with the charging case
2657,5.0, you can do touch commands on it and ask siri questions if youre connected to wifi or data
2658,5.0, its slick and easy to charge and use
2659,5.0, you can set up the touch commands in the iphone
2660,5.0, you can check the battery life if you open the case near to the iphone
2661,5.0, it can be connected with android but it does lose some of its function like siri
2662,5.0, JUST DONT LOSE AN EARPHONE BECAUSE ITS EXPENSIVE LIKE CRAZY
2663,5.0, TO BE SPECIFIC ITS 75 DOLLARS OR SO DEPENDING ON THE TAX
2664,3.0,"I’ve tried a variety of earbuds, I finally broke down and bought the AirPods BUT I don’t feel like they are worth it"
2665,3.0," I mean they’re fine, but they don’t work well for running"
2666,3.0," they don’t fall out but moisture (sweat) causes them to to disconnect because their sensors malfunction, I don’t know if that’s just me and it’s not like my ears are actually sweating inside it’s just sweat coming from my head"
2667,3.0, They don’t have the functions that other earbuds have (like tap for next/pause/volume) and the stress of worrying about losing them is overwhelming
2668,3.0, They’re perfectly fine for walking and sitting and I often find that I forget I have them in because they’re relatively comfortable
2669,3.0, But it’s easy to knock them out and if you lay down they can shift and “disconnect” again because the sensors aren’t touching your ear on both sides of the earbud
2670,3.0, If you think you can use these earbuds and wear earmuffs at the same time (ear protection for loud machinery) think again
2671,3.0, The lightest touch can knock one out then your audio stops and you’re left with an earbud in the earmuff
2672,3.0," The noise cancellation is fine, I’m a female who generally only has one in at a time for safety reasons, and the sound is fine"
2673,3.0, I’ve had better sound from cheaper earbuds
2674,3.0," Im sure all of these things are unique to the user, maybe my ears are weirdly shaped, maybe I sweat more than most people"
2675,3.0, It just doesn’t feel like they’re worth the money
2676,3.0," On a positive note, they’re great for phone calls"
2677,2.0,I've always wanted AirPods but found the cost too expensive
2678,2.0, I was really happy when I found these AirPods for cheaper and I found the double tap feature really convenient when I'm on the go
2679,2.0," Unfortunately, I've experienced multiple issues with them"
2680,2.0,I often find the notification that my AirPods are connected when they're in the case and the case is closed
2681,2.0," I thought it was because I was using an older phone, but I just got the new iPhone 13 and the issues persist"
2682,2.0," It's pretty annoying to have the notification because while it's at the top of my screen, I can't swipe down to access the notification bar, and it takes a while to go away"
2683,2.0, There was a time when I was playing music through the speaker and the music stopped because my phone said my AirPods had connected
2684,2.0,I've also had issues with the double tap feature
2685,2.0," There are times when my music pauses by itself and though my hair sometimes brushes against, I just don't think it can mimic a double tap"
2686,2.0, There are also times when the headphones won't respond to a double tap
2687,2.0,"Lastly, they die so quickly"
2688,2.0," I don't know if this is normal for all AirPods but it feels like I'm constantly having to charge them, whereas my other Bluetooth headphones can run for days on a single charge"
2689,2.0, I'm pretty bummed that these didn't work out
2690,5.0,Love these
2691,5.0," Took me a few years to finally purchase because of the cost, but would 100% recommend buying if you are on the fence"
2692,5.0," They are super easy to use, very lightweight and they work great"
2693,5.0, They connect to my phone without problems 99% of the time and the sound quality is perfect
2694,5.0, They are far superior to any other headphones I have used and will never use anything else
2695,5.0,"After having them for a good 6 months now, there are rare times where they have issues connecting"
2696,5.0," Its not a major complaint and it never stays that way, just occasionally they just wont connect"
2697,5.0, I usually just place them back in the case and the next time they work fine
2698,4.0,"I have been using the airpods for about a month now, and I am a first time Apple product user"
2699,4.0,I have purchased less expensive airpods/earbuds and these are the best by far
2700,4.0,"Shipping was fast, and packaging was in tact"
2701,4.0,"Connectivity: I have an android phone, and connecting the airpods to my nonapple product was super easy"
2702,4.0,"Sound: When making and receiving phone calls, the sound quality was good"
2703,4.0, Way better than the other 3 earbud brands I own
2704,4.0," There was no choppiness, no computerized sound and the other party/myself did not sound like we were at a distance"
2705,4.0, Music and video sound was crisp
2706,4.0,Distance: I live in an apartment
2707,4.0," So I was able to leave my cell phone in room A, and go to rooms B and C without losing connection"
2708,4.0, I also was able to go outside without losing connection
2709,4.0,Battery life: Kind of short
2710,4.0," If you're on a 5+ hour road trip or flight, you'll have to recharge your pods"
2711,4.0," Overall, 5 hours is not bad"
2712,4.0,Fit: They don't fall out of my ears
2713,4.0," Also, It's more comfortable to use headphones for extended amounts of time"
2714,4.0, Only because there is no cushion on the airpods
2715,4.0,The charging dock for the airpods is small and compact
2716,4.0, I usually keep it connected to my laptop to keep it charged
2717,4.0,"Overall the apple airpods are worth the price, and I do recommend this product"
2718,3.0,I’ve owned these for a month and debated returning them a few times
2719,3.0, 1
2720,3.0,) I’m pretty sure the pair I received was not “new” even though they appeared to be
2721,3.0," It seemed like someone may have tried them, returned them and they were repackaged to appear new"
2722,3.0," I thought I might be being paranoid having received multiple used items across Amazon at this point, so I cleaned them and decided to keep"
2723,3.0, 2
2724,3.0,) I am currently waiting on a replacement for the left pod less than a month in
2725,3.0, It had a defective battery right out of the box
2726,3.0, I’m not sure if that’s Apple’s fault or if someone else got them and returned for the same reason
2727,3.0, Either way Apple is replacing it free of charge since it dies within 30 minutes on a full charge (so at least they’re real)
2728,3.0,I like the AirPods but I’m not sure I trust Amazon with these purchases anymore
2729,3.0, I probably wouldn’t buy them on Amazon again
2730,2.0,I have the first gen
2731,2.0, AirPods for several years before I lost one to a dog incident and the other to a washing machine
2732,2.0, LOVED THEM but didn't have the money to invest in a new pair at the time
2733,2.0," Tried a few knockoff brands for $20-$30 and had decent success but when I started travelling weekly for work, it was time to up the game again"
2734,2.0, Bought the new generation model and have been wildly disappointed ever since
2735,2.0," Static regularly, battery life in average, on Zoom meetings they start going haywire at about the 40 minute mark and they only intermittently connect to my Microsoft Surface (which the knockoff brands had no problem doing)"
2736,2.0, Maybe I just got a bunk pair of these but if I could go back to the originals I would
2737,2.0," If I could also get my $200 back, I'd do that too"
2738,2.0, Sometimes newer isn't better
2739,5.0,"I use these at least daily (mainly for my morning walks) and so far, so good"
2740,5.0, The sound is decent and I enjoy the “touch” technology that is built in
2741,5.0, I have my right ear set to next song and my left to Siri which allows for an almost completely hands free experience once I get my playlist selected
2742,5.0," These are a replacement to the first generation ones, which sadly went missing on a trip"
2743,5.0," I do feel that the first generation ones fit in my ears a bit better, but these still fit, just not as seemlessly"
2744,5.0," They are not noise canceling, but I need to be somewhat aware of my surroundings when walking so that’s fine with me"
2745,5.0," I did try a family member’s airpod pros and honestly, the fit was awful, so for me, especially with the Black Friday deal I got, these were the best option"
2746,5.0,"I have had other ear buds from all kinds of companies, I wish I could afford a Bose, but I can’t"
2747,5.0," My brother said I should try them, so On prime day I splurged"
2748,5.0, This was the first time that I listened to music and I could hear the small nuances of instruments in the background
2749,5.0," Some of them I never knew were there, or talking at the end of the song, and it was clear"
2750,5.0,I can hear people very well and they tell me they can hear me very well also
2751,5.0," And I am slightly hard of hearing, so being on the phone with the earbuds is the best thing ever"
2752,5.0,"If you ever want to know how great these earbuds are, and it might not be your thing, but put on a Depeche Mode song"
2753,5.0, You’ll be astonished at what you can hear
2754,5.0, If you don’t have a pair of these you’re really should- Worth every penny
2755,4.0,A FEW DAYS AFTER MY REVIEW
2756,4.0,CHANGE THE 5 STAR TO 4: It’s stilly excellent
2757,4.0," My friends can hear me very well and I, them"
2758,4.0," Their complain is there hearing a lot of background noise and apparently, I can do nothing to stop that"
2759,4.0," I thought I’d use them for conversation in store, but now, I hesitate to do so, because friends would be side tracked with all the sound around me"
2760,4.0, Still the best I could find and the best that is recommended by my friends
2761,4.0," FIRST REVIEW WAS 5 start—as follows: Silly thought, right"
2762,4.0, Everything about these ear buds is what I hoped
2763,4.0,quality
2764,4.0," How hard It is, purchasing anything these days and being anxious about the quality or lack there of, no matter what you pay for the product"
2765,4.0," (If this is confusing to you, please read the novel Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand"
2766,4.0,") The ear specific fit, sound quality, apperance"
2767,4.0,all are wonderful
2768,4.0, Ease of connecting to any of my devices
2769,4.0,WONDERFUL
2770,4.0," I cannot rate construction longevity nor battery life, because I have only had them for a few days, and before that, I had the plug in buds that I rarely used, because I kept sitting the phone down to use my hands in the kitchen, and dragging my phone off Of a surface by moving around"
2771,4.0," Trying to hear friends on their speakers, because they are busy, too became frustrating"
2772,4.0, This WAS the perfect answer
2773,4.0," They hear me better and finally, I can hear them even when they turn their back to their phone"
2774,4.0, You will hear from me if they break down anytime soon
2775,4.0,promise
2776,4.0," Since my iphone is the new SE2020, trouble shooting, if any problem arrises, will definitely be a breeze"
2777,4.0, I am so enjoying these airbuds
2778,4.0, Voice activation helped type this review
2779,1.0,My AirPods keep disconnecting
2780,1.0, Sometimes only the left AirPod works - have to reset and reconnect
2781,1.0," Just yesterday, even after charging the AirPods for few hours, the right AirPod stays at 0%"
2782,1.0, Have a reset and charge again
2783,1.0, It has been a hassle so far
2784,1.0," I don’t have an Apple store near me, the closest one is 200 miles, so I have no option other than using it by resetting it every time"
2785,1.0, Not sure if this is an authentic product that I received
2786,1.0," I am out of return period, so nothing can be done, unfortunately"
2787,1.0,"In order to determine whether or not these AirPods were real, I immediately checked to see if the serial number matched Apple's official website"
2788,1.0, The number couldn't be verified
2789,1.0," After opening the box, I noticed two things: ""the Designed by Apple in California"" was black, not grey, and inside the case were small black particles"
2790,1.0, Not only was it until I visited helpful websites that explain how to spot fake AirPods that I knew these were fake
2791,1.0, Please don't be fooled by the packaging
2792,1.0,"Of course, this does not mean that all airpods from Amazon are fake"
2793,1.0, A friend of mine purchased them from here last year and hers was verifiable
2794,1.0," So, I think it's a case-by-case situation"
2795,1.0, Make sure to do some research once you receive the package
2796,1.0,"Overall, I was looking so forward to finally purchasing my first Airpods, but the end result was very dismaying and disappointing"
2797,1.0," Although it would cost more, to play it safe, I would recommend purchasing from the official website"
2798,5.0,I have been a gym workout Rat for many years
2799,5.0," I presently workout at my gym 3 daws a week, 2hours each"
2800,5.0," I find workouts good, tough and can be boring"
2801,5.0," My gym played music at one time, but then it was discontinued"
2802,5.0," I purchased a Sandisk, Sansa Clip with 2 memory cards and used it for years until it no longer worked"
2803,5.0," Then I started noticing these people with white stems hanging out their ears, looked funny"
2804,5.0," When I checked into these, I found that they were air and ear pods"
2805,5.0, One of my friends let me try his Apple AirPods
2806,5.0, I was very impressed until I heard the price
2807,5.0," As a result over the next couple of months, I purchased two other brands at $45"
2808,5.0,00 each
2809,5.0," Both had technical issues, so I finally returned them and purchased the more expensive Apple AirPods, 2nd generation and since then, I have never looked back"
2810,5.0," Easy setup, easy music selection and easy streaming"
2811,5.0, So now I am one of the gym rats that walks around with White things hanging out his ears
2812,5.0, Great decision
2813,2.0,I love how comfortable these are
2814,2.0, The sound quality is good and the Bluetooth range is impressive
2815,2.0, The battery life is fine
2816,2.0," Nothing incredible, but it will get you through 3-4 days before you have to charge the case again"
2817,2.0," However, they DO NOT last"
2818,2.0, I bought a pair of the original AirPods and they lasted about a year before the microphone went out on the left ear
2819,2.0, 3 months later the microphone on the right AirPod went out
2820,2.0,Because I have small ears I have a hard time finding earbuds that work so I caved and bought a gen 2 about 6 months ago
2821,2.0,Guess what happened
2822,2.0, Yep
2823,2.0, The left microphone went out
2824,2.0, I fully anticipate the right one will go anytime now
2825,2.0,So even though these are comfortable and have great sound quality I do not recommend
2826,2.0, If I’m spending more than $100 for earbuds they should work for more than 6-12 months
2827,2.0,I’m on the hunt again and I’ll find something that lasts more than a minute
2828,2.0, Or something cheap enough that it won’t hurt my feelings to have to replace every 6 months
2829,1.0,What an absolute waste of money
2830,1.0,I got these airbuds because of their shape--it's about the only shape that fits in my ear and stays
2831,1.0, I was also excited about the functionality of the earbuds
2832,1.0," However, the earbuds were never fully functional"
2833,1.0," I was never able to get the earbuds to switch through songs, for example"
2834,1.0," They did pause and play whatever I was listening to, but they most often did this when I would accidentally touch the earbuds"
2835,1.0, Or my hair grazed the earbuds
2836,1.0," So, really they were not very functional at all anyway"
2837,1.0," But I could use them to listen to music, and I'm really not super picky, so I just kept using them"
2838,1.0,"About two months in, one of the earbuds fell onto a hardwood floor and broke open"
2839,1.0," I was able to kind of stick it back together, but it never worked after that"
2840,1.0," Within days, the magnetic metal bottom of both earbuds fell off"
2841,1.0,At this point I contacted the seller and told them the issues
2842,1.0, They said they would send a new pair
2843,1.0, I waited weeks
2844,1.0," Still waiting, months after my purchase, for any kind of communication"
2845,1.0," I had to escalate my complaints through amazon, but the best they could do was refund half of the price"
2846,1.0,DON'T BUY THESE
2847,1.0,"And if you really want to, at least don't buy these from this seller"
2848,5.0,I bought these mainly for calls
2849,5.0, The sound quality is great and they’re very convenient
2850,5.0, I might wear them a could hours in a row for calls and not even notice
2851,5.0, The charge lasts for hours
2852,5.0,I wear them to listen to music while flying as well
2853,5.0, They’re not noise canceling but suit my purposes just fine
2854,5.0, I don't hear normal cabin noises while wearing them
2855,5.0,"However, they don’t stay in my ears as well as some people report"
2856,5.0, I couldn’t use these while being active for instance
2857,5.0, I’ve already chased one that fell out and rolled down a plane aisle
2858,5.0,"I was on the fence for quite awhile about whether I needed these as I own everything Apple, but I held back and that was a mistake"
2859,5.0, Apple quality SHINES once again
2860,5.0," Everything about these is exactly as you would expect from Apple, you really do get what you pay for"
2861,5.0," I am very pleased with the airpods, I am enjoying them as I write this review, the sound is absolutely excellent"
2862,5.0, I had zero issues setting them up with my Iphone
2863,5.0," The quality in craftsmanship and quality is pure Apple, The sound is amazingly excellent"
2864,5.0, They are comfortable to wear
2865,5.0, I have not tried any heavy duty physical activity with them on but I'm sure there are other reviews here that cover that
2866,5.0, I waited too long
2867,5.0, The price is reasonable for something that will give you many years of pleasure
2868,5.0,"My original bluetooth, over the ear, hands-free device was starting to drop calls after having it for five years"
2869,5.0, I was in the hunt for a new device and was debating on whether to purchase these
2870,5.0, I absolutely LOVE THEM
2871,5.0,"I was afraid that they would not stay in my ears, especially as I love to hike and do yoga"
2872,5.0," I have had no issues with them staying in, even in upside down yoga positions"
2873,5.0, They are very comfortable and the sound is amazing
2874,5.0," The battery life is extensive and if I need to charge the pods, I just pop then in the charger for 3 minutes and an able to get more life"
2875,5.0,"There are only two negatives, in my opinion"
2876,5.0," One, I cannot connect to more than one device at a time like I did with old bluetooth device"
2877,5.0," This is a pain for me as I have a personal and work cell phone, so I have to make a choice to which device I will connect to"
2878,5.0," Two, when I receive a call, I have to physically look at my phone or Apple watch to see who is calling and physically answer it"
2879,5.0," My old bluetooth device would tell me who was calling and I could respond by saying ""answer"" or ""ignore"
2880,5.0,""" Even though these are big negatives for me, they are 100% worth every penny"
2881,5.0, They were cheaper on Amazon than the Apple store and I did not have to leave my house to get them
2882,5.0,"Creo que la calidad del sonido podría mejorar , es muy buena , pero no a nivel de marcas como Bose por ejemplo "
2883,5.0," se escuchan bastante parecido a los audífonos Apple con cable solo que tienen la comodidad de no usar cable , solo eso "
2884,5.0, Se conectan rápido y la duración de la batería es muy buena 
2885,3.0,They are completely better than Amazon Echo Buds 2nd version
2886,3.0, These never disconnect and the range goes far
2887,3.0, I don't like that you can't set up the mute by tapping one of the AirPods
2888,3.0, That's a big disappointment for me
2889,3.0, I mainly use these for phone calls
2890,3.0," I am told that people on the other end of a phone call can hear absolutely everything I am doing, but doesn't seem to be that big of a deal"
2891,3.0, I like the ease of use with Siri
2892,3.0," These are just real smooth and simple, from set up to actual use"
2893,1.0,I paid for new AirPods and got USED ones
2894,1.0, They came with someone's name
2895,1.0, How can they sell stuff like this
2896,1.0, Order directly from Apple
2897,2.0,very poor sound quality
2898,2.0, Had 15 dollar airpods which sounded better
2899,2.0, These are not even Mediocre but you pay money of a high end audiophile airpods
2900,2.0, A big No
2901,1.0,"had the item one day, it is genuine apple but any time I open the lid I get connection error messages, or a ""not your airpods"" message"
2902,1.0, despite them being connected
2903,1.0,have been in contact with apple support for about 45 minutes on the same day as I received my product
2904,1.0,apple ecosystem huh -_-
2905,1.0,they do sound very ok for wireless earbuds
2906,1.0,they do pair with anything that isn't apple just fine
2907,1.0,everything works as advertised with the exception of the apple ecosystem they charge a premium for
2908,5.0,I have an iPhone and wanted a good pair of wireless headphones but without Apple's price
2909,5.0," After trying about 6 different brands and returning them or just wasting money on them I decided to bite the bullet and just get the Air Pods, now I wish I did it sooner"
2910,5.0," They sound great, I like that I can just say Hey Siri to change the volume, and they are so useful"
2911,5.0," I use them daily when working by either listening to music when working on a project or talking to customers, I also use them when mowing the lawn or just running to the store"
2912,5.0, These do not noise canceling but they isolate the background noise well but not to the point where you cant hear around you
2913,5.0," I am surprised on how long the battery actually lasts for such a small package, also the storage case/charger is great because if I am running low on power I just plug them in for 15 min or so and have enough power to take several more calls"
2914,5.0,I would recommend these to others and I am even going to buy a pair for my fiance to replace her off the wall wireless earbuds
2915,1.0,Airpods are great and make life so convenient with Apple products
2916,1.0," However, less than a year from purchase and I'm having battery issues with them already"
2917,1.0," While at about 15%, they will decide to just turn off at any given moment"
2918,1.0," After contacting Apple and working through their tech support for two weeks, they tell me that I need to send them in for Apple to diagnose the problem with them before determining a solution"
2919,1.0," This is after them installing diagnostic software on my phone, countless screen shots of battery life and physically being on the phone with Apple as they died"
2920,1.0," In my opinion, regardless of all the great features, these are complete junk if they can't even make it a year before malfunctioning"
2921,4.0,"I remember when Airpods first came out, and I was hesitant to purchase them because I thought it was insane to buy a wireless pair of standard Apple earbuds for the same price of a much higher quality pair of headphones"
2922,4.0," However, the convenience factor and ease of use has really changed my mind about these"
2923,4.0," The sound is decent, the bass leaves a little to be desired, but everything else is clear and loud"
2924,4.0," The fit is really good for my ears, but this will vary person to person"
2925,4.0," The battery life is nice, I've had these for about a month now and I have yet to find myself in a situation where the case or the pods don't have any battery when I need it, and I forget to charge the case all the time"
2926,4.0," The Bluetooth pairing happens almost instantly, although sometimes my phone will connect but then not choose to output the sound through the AirPods, but I think this is just user error, so nothing to complain about there, just be aware that this might happen so if you're trying to be quiet, make sure it's playing through the right output"
2927,4.0," Only con I can think of is it seems a little expensive to get these and not get a wireless charging case, but all Apple products carry a premium so I can't complain all that much"
2928,4.0," All together, I'm really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend these if you're looking for a convenient pair of wireless earbuds"
2929,1.0,"It’s been a month and I still haven’t gotten my refund, because the sound on my left pod was very quiet"
2930,4.0,(Honest review: I paid full retail price and received nothing of value for this review
2931,4.0,)
2932,4.0,I liked these a lot--until I tried the AirPod Pros
2933,4.0,"Sound quality is more than adequate, not the best, and convenience with iOS devices is great"
2934,4.0, I primarily bought these for use working on videoconferencing and telephone calls
2935,4.0, They worked very well
2936,4.0,"For these purposes, however, get the Pro version"
2937,4.0," In addition to being more comfortable* and less prone to falling out than the AirPods, the sound is at least as good and the noise cancellation is awesome"
2938,4.0, It makes all the difference for working
2939,4.0," After trying the Pro version, I gave away my AirPods"
2940,4.0,"*Usually I find ""intrusive"" ear buds uncomfortable and expected that the AirPods would be more comfortable for me than the Pros"
2941,4.0, This is not what I found
2942,4.0," The Pros are the most comfortable ""intrusive"" ear buds I have ever tried (including many premium manufacturers' offerings)"
2943,4.0,"I used to doubt the usefulness of Airpods, so I got a pair on a whim when they went on sale"
2944,4.0," I am generally used to higher-end headphones, I have pairs ranging from Sennheisers to Focal Clears, and a pair of Wh100xm3"
2945,4.0,"After a month or so of use, I now see why they are so popular"
2946,4.0," I use an iPhone, so they connect seamlessly the second I open my phone"
2947,4.0, Much faster than any of my other Bluetooth headphones
2948,4.0,"But here is their biggest quality: they come in a concealable package, making them much easier to take on and off then full sized headphones"
2949,4.0,My only gripes with these are: lack of noise cancelling (which is usually a problem in IEM headphones)
2950,4.0,But more importantly: comfort
2951,4.0, These headphones either fit you great or they don't
2952,4.0," For me, they don't really fit me as well as id like, but the practically makes up for it"
2953,4.0,"Give them a try, you won't regret it for daily use"
2954,5.0,"So glad that I went with it, I read all the reviews and decided well I’ll go with it,"
2955,5.0,"Glad I did, I thought due to the price that they were going to,be some apple reject but no"
2956,5.0,"And the battery is superb cause the last one I owned (not Apple) the batteries would die in 20 minutes, yes 20 minutes however I didn’t get them from Amazon bUt purchased on FB so just l buy the originals cause you end up spending and loosing at the end"
2957,5.0,Try them
2958,1.0,I have been taking meticulous care of these ear buds as I have heard they can be somewhat fragile
2959,1.0,Shortly after the return deadline I had my left earbud start to play everything noticeably quieter
2960,1.0," I have tried everything from reconnecting, letting them drain battery and Different devices"
2961,1.0,nothing made a difference
2962,1.0, Since I no longer have the box I can not get them covered on Apples side of things
2963,1.0, I am pretty much forced to order a replacement through apple
2964,5.0,"I am extremely happy with these AirPods, they are amazing"
2965,5.0, They automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out
2966,5.0, How great is that
2967,5.0, Then while listening a simple double-tap will skip forward
2968,5.0," To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" "
2969,5.0," When you're on a call or talking to Siri, apple technology filters out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency"
2970,5.0,"Whats even more impressive they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time"
2971,5.0, Just 15 minutes in the case gives you about three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time
2972,5.0," These are my first airpods so I can not compare with the first gen, but I highly highly reccommend these airpods"
2973,5.0,The breakdown on how I determine my star rating of a product…
2974,5.0,5 stars – I love it
2975,5.0, It is awesome and I highly recommend that everyone purchase this product
2976,5.0,4 stars – I like it
2977,5.0, Not everything can be perfect
2978,5.0, I would purchase again
2979,5.0,"3 stars – It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless I had no other choices"
2980,5.0,"2 stars – There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices"
2981,5.0,"1 star – I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and do not recommend anyone else to purchase it"
2982,5.0,If my review helped please take a second and click that it was helpful below
2983,5.0,"These are genuine, confirmed the serial number with Apple"
2984,5.0,This is my second pair
2985,5.0, After constant use for phone calls for 2 years the batteries in the AirPods were only lasting 30-40 minutes when used for phone calls
2986,5.0,5-6 hours a day I talk on the phone using these and everyone says they can't even tell I'm on bluetooth which is an impressive feat considering how small they are
2987,5.0,I hope this pair treats me as well as my first pair did
2988,5.0,I highly recommend these if you are looking for a bluetooth headset for phone calls
2989,5.0, The batteries dont last as long as some but you can keep swapping between using one at a time
2990,5.0,I have an iPhone XR and wanted some wireless headphones
2991,5.0, I went with an off brand at first and it was a terrible decision
2992,5.0, After that experience I knew I needed to just buy the Apple brand and get a good product
2993,5.0," Yes, they are a little more expensive than an off brand - but seriously"
2994,5.0, They are worth it and more
2995,5.0,If you're hesitating like I did at first
2996,5.0," Let me tell you for sound quality, battery life, and ease of use - this is the product you want"
2997,5.0, No doubt
2998,4.0,I wanted wireless headphones because I wear them while I exercise outdoors in the morning and while I clean the house etc and was tired of getting hung up on the cord
2999,4.0, I bought these to use on my Galaxy S8 because there are no Android headphones on the market of this shape
3000,4.0, I can't stand the type that push into your ear canal so I was happy to read that these would work with android
3001,4.0, You don't get all the features with an android device obviously but that was of little concern to me
3002,4.0, I don't need to tell Siri to turn up the volume or battery life to be displayed on my screen
3003,4.0, The only issues I have are with the headphones themselves that have nothing to do with android usage
3004,4.0," First, they are a bit uncomfortable for someone with smaller ears I guess"
3005,4.0, The hard plastic rubs on my inner ear with long usage
3006,4.0, My husband doesn't have this problem with his
3007,4.0, I am also have trouble with them cutting out a bit and sometimes going out of sync when I am using them to stream
3008,4.0, It is worse when I put my phone in my pocket
3009,4.0, I have read online that this is an issue with bluetooth so seems to be an issue with both apple and android devices
3010,5.0,"One day, I was at the poolside listening to music with these AirPods"
3011,5.0," It was 80°, not a single cloud in the sky"
3012,5.0," I enjoyed the heat, but decided to jump into the pool to cool off"
3013,5.0," As I’m completely submerged in water, I realized my music was still playing in my ears… underwater"
3014,5.0," Of course, the longer I stayed under water, I realized that the audio was cutting out"
3015,5.0, So then I frantically get them out onto the side of the pool away from the water
3016,5.0," I dried it off with a towel, and let it sit for a little bit"
3017,5.0," Then, I got onto my golf cart to go back home and popped my AirPods back in"
3018,5.0, Both AirPods survived the water
3019,5.0, I lived happily ever after
3020,5.0,Thanks
3021,1.0,One of the earpods stop working after 3wks and I thought maybe it's the battery
3022,1.0," I charged it, precautiousely, so I dont overcharge; and it started working again for another whole week"
3023,1.0," Then, on the 4th week of buying this crappy thing, both headphones stopped working"
3024,1.0, I know it's not because of overcharging because I definitely took precautions
3025,1.0, It was definitely a faulty product being sold to me
3026,1.0, But that wasn't the good part of this ordeal
3027,1.0, Upon trying to return this product
3028,1.0, I realized that my eligible return date has expired 2days prior b4 my airpods decided to malfunction
3029,1.0, So hurray
3030,1.0, I am stuck with a pair of dead broke $144 Apple Airpods purchased on Amazon
3031,1.0," O, Happy me"
3032,5.0,My husband surprised me and bought these for me on Prime Day
3033,5.0," I've never been a 'head phone' person, always preferred to listen to my music w/o an interface"
3034,5.0," I still don't like anything in my ears, but these are really terrific"
3035,5.0, My main focus is classical music which has been a life-long passion
3036,5.0," Music sounds crystalline; bass is good, not gut shaking like my stereo system, but still fine; trebble is good as well"
3037,5.0,Now I've put apps for my favorite classical staions on my phone so I can listen to them sitting on my lanai
3038,5.0, I can also listen to my old iPod which has so much of my favorites on it
3039,5.0," Now when the Saturday opera matinee is playing, I can listen with my air pods"
3040,5.0," While my husband likes classical, he still hates opera"
3041,5.0,"I purchased these wireless earbuds after receiving defective AirPod Pros, and I’m glad I “downgraded"
3042,5.0,"” I normally have trouble fitting silicone seal earbuds in my ears, so the fact that these just sit in the outer ear is actually a plus for me"
3043,5.0," Connecting them to my Apple devices (watch, iPhone, iPad) was very easy, and almost instant"
3044,5.0," I have not tried connecting them to Android phones or Windows computers, so I’m not sure how well they work for those devices"
3045,5.0,"For an audio device that doesn’t cancel sound, the sound quality is amazing"
3046,5.0," They are probably a little better than the stock iPhone wired earbuds, for reference"
3047,5.0," Nothing crazy, but I’m pleased with them"
3048,5.0," Since they don’t cancel sound, I can also wear them around the house or out on walks with my dog without the fear that someone will try to get my attention and I won’t hear them"
3049,5.0,"As someone who almost never buys warranties, I would highly recommend the 2-year AppleCare+ subscription for these AirPods, since it covers everything from damage, to theft, to loss"
3050,1.0,"I mean honestly, I expected them to be exactly like the ones that came with all the previous generations of iPod and Apple iPhone only with no wires… I feel like there’s a slight variation in how powerful they are meaning less powerful than the ones with the wires but more importantly yeah mine just kind of stopped working"
3051,1.0," Have them for less than two weeks they make the Connect and disconnect noises however, the only thing that actually works perfectly is when I use them for telephone calls"
3052,1.0," And when I’m on telephone calls, in the event I would like to listen to media or music or watch YouTube while I’m on a phone call, they will work perfectly the music media or YouTube will turn down and I can hear the person perfectly"
3053,1.0, The second person hangs up the AirPods then go back to not working at all that’s right I said it folks other than the connect disconnect the sound they do not work at all
3054,1.0," Of course, other than the aforementioned phone calls which they work as they are designed to"
3055,1.0, It’s extremely frustrating I have actually had the opportunity to get a second pair sent to me from Amazon and they work just the same
3056,1.0, I can’t find anything online about what to do my iPhone is brand new so I don’t know why my phones doing this but no one can give me a good answer and frankly I don’t want to anymore because I just wasted a bunch of money on and they don’t work for anything
3057,1.0,I am so angry it’s not even funny
3058,1.0, I have purchased so many things
3059,1.0, Sometimes they are flops but I bought this believing it was new
3060,1.0, Came with and inspected sticker on it
3061,1.0, Noticed the box was taped with regular tape
3062,1.0, I just opened it so I could figure out what size case to get my son as this is his Christmas gift
3063,1.0, There is ear wax on the ear buds
3064,1.0, I am furious
3065,1.0, And highly disappointed in amazon
3066,1.0, Wish I could give negative stars
3067,2.0,These were fantastic and a game changer for me for the first few months
3068,2.0, But the left pod stopped working recently
3069,2.0, I've tried everything
3070,2.0, From checking out message boards online to reading other reviews and looking for similar issues
3071,2.0, It was a quick progression
3072,2.0, First it took a while for the left to connect
3073,2.0, Then it just stopped working no matter what
3074,2.0," Shows up as green, 100% battery but still no sound ever comes out of it"
3075,2.0," Otherwise, I'd recommend AirPods to anyone with Apple devices as they are smart, sleek and convenient"
3076,2.0, Guess I just got a bad individual product
3077,2.0, Probably should have gone directly through Apple for something like this just to be safe
3078,5.0,"Although I am huge Apple fan, I was initially skeptical about buying Apple AirPods"
3079,5.0, I already had a different brand bluetooth headset (which was so-so) and for some reason I didn't have high expectations of AirPods
3080,5.0, But these AirPods really beat my expectations
3081,5.0," They are light, easily chargeable and have solid sound quality"
3082,5.0," I mainly use it for business calls from iPhone, and this is just magic"
3083,5.0," Crystal clear quality, like snowflakes in my ears"
3084,5.0, I wish I got them earlier
3085,5.0, The only drawback is a bit weird way to check case charge level
3086,5.0, You need to open the case in proximity to your iPhone with AirPods in
3087,5.0," I find this strange, I wish there was easier and more streamlined way to check it"
3088,5.0," At any rate, this is a great product and I do recommend it to Apple fans"
3089,4.0,"After trying three imitation EarPods, I finally swallowed my pride and some dollars and got these AirPods"
3090,4.0, Totally worth it
3091,4.0, They fit really well in my ears and have MUCH better sound quality than any other Bluetooth earphones I’ve used
3092,4.0, I often use one at a time and rotate through them so haven’t been too concerned about the battery life
3093,4.0, My teen says hers used to last several hours but now only last an hour and the one she used more often now has diminished sound quality
3094,4.0, I’ve also noticed the diminished quality in the left pod that I use more often
3095,4.0," Even diminished, the sound quality is better than other pairs I’ve had"
3096,4.0, Not as good as the wired apple earphones but I prefer the Bluetooth ones for most of my daily activities as I still manage to get myself caught in the wires and inadvertently fling expensive things to the ground more often than I’d like
3097,5.0,I’m not exactly sure how long I’ve had these AirPods but it’s been a long time
3098,5.0, If you take care of them they won’t let you down
3099,5.0, The only problem I’ve had it sometimes it doesn’t detect that it’s in my ears and I have to take them out and cover the sensors with my fingers to force it
3100,5.0, I haven’t lost any audio in either pod so it’s still going strong
3101,5.0, The audio is clear and relatively good bass
3102,5.0, For some people they can fall out easily but I’ve gone running and trail biking and it hasn’t fallen out once
3103,4.0,At first I was skeptical in buying this off Amazon and thought I’d be getting a knock off but I can say I’m definitely impressed
3104,4.0," I decided to buy 2 pairs of these, one for myself and one for my husband for a Father’s Day gift"
3105,4.0," Working from home, I was getting tired of wearing a headset taking calls and having zoom meetings"
3106,4.0, This has definitely been a game changer for me
3107,4.0," I love that I am able to connect it to my phone, laptop, and car with Bluetooth"
3108,4.0," It’s great that when I want to figure out what my battery percentage is for both the charging case and AirPods, it’ll tell me on my phone just by opening the charging case and the percentage for both will appear on the bottom of my phone screen"
3109,4.0," You can also tell when your case needs to be charged because there will be an orange light and if it’s charged enough, the light will be green as I show in the pictures"
3110,4.0, Same with the headphones
3111,4.0," If you place the AirPods into the charging cradle, there will be an orange light if the charge is low and a green light when they are fully charged"
3112,4.0, These are not something you can wear for an entire day because the inside of your ear can become sore so I wear them when it’s necessary during my day
3113,4.0," I love that there’s a feature where if I do have my headphones on, Siri will read my messages to me and you can send a reply as well"
3114,4.0, Siri feature is definitely great for when I am in the middle of something
3115,4.0," Battery life, these haven’t lasted me for an entire day"
3116,4.0," I also love that when the AirPods are about to die, there’s a DUN-DUN noise that plays to let you know put me on the chargerrrrr"
3117,4.0," Other than that, I’m satisfied with my purchase and my husband will love the surprise when he receives it"
3118,3.0,I want to like these
3119,3.0," They're easy to use, sound decent for music, and they work well for phone calls"
3120,3.0," But Apple's ""one size fits all"" scheme doesn't work for me"
3121,3.0, I should have guessed these wouldn't fit me properly
3122,3.0, Apple's wired earpods that come with every iPhone tend to fall out of my ears easily
3123,3.0, Why would the wireless version of the same thing be different
3124,3.0,Apple really should offer these in more than one size
3125,3.0,"On battery life, I was on the phone listening to music and/or the news at a reasonable volume for about an hour, then I was on the phone for about two more hours"
3126,3.0, Indicated battery charge went down from 100% to only 25%
3127,3.0," Granted, it's a brand new device, so the batteries might not be quite ""broken in"" yet, but I don't find that impressive"
3128,3.0,"I'd give these a more of a chance and a longer review, but since they simply don't fit right, they don't work for me"
3129,3.0, They're going back
3130,5.0,Lets face it these AirPods are by Apple so you know that they are excellent quality
3131,5.0, I absolutely LOVE them and after having them for just one day wonder how I managed without them
3132,5.0, For volume control either have Siri adjust the volume or do it manually
3133,5.0,"PRO I love the fact that if an AirPod happens to fall from your ear the media that you were streaming will be paused until the AirPod is reinserted, very cool"
3134,5.0," I also love that once inserted in ears an on screen charge status shows up, also very cool"
3135,5.0, I bough a clear silicone case for the AirPods Charging case as 1- Its very small and slick so could easily fall from hands 2- Better protection in event of contact with water (rain)
3136,5.0, For less than 150 USD you have these marvellous EarPods which is a fantastic buy IMO
3137,5.0,CON I suspect that these are Generation 1 AirPods as there is no LED charging indicator light on the front of the case
3138,5.0, No biggie as to check charge status simply take out & reinsert in one ear & onscreen status appears
3139,5.0, Another con is that there is absolutely no noise cancelling ability whatsoever
3140,5.0," It's just like using wired ear buds, unless you have a high volume (not recommended if you still want hearing after age 60) you will hear the surrounding noise"
3141,5.0,"While the latest series of EarPods does offer the noise cancelling ability, you will pay for it accordingly"
3142,5.0," I am quite happy with these EarPods and if you don't need the noise cancelling feature, I'm certain you will be too"
3143,1.0,We purchased the AirPods at Christmas time 2019 as a gift
3144,1.0, Unfortunately we did not return them in time to receive a refund
3145,1.0, The quality is unacceptable and noting like we would expect from aN Apple product that was purchased from Amazon
3146,1.0, We compared this set with the Apple AirPods we purchased from Costco
3147,1.0, The AirPods purchased at Costco were of superior quality and exceeded our expectations
3148,1.0, The AirPods purchased from Amazon I suspect are likely counterfeit
3149,1.0," Moving forward, I will purchase Apple products form Costco or directly from the Apple Store"
3150,5.0,I ordered the APPLE AirPods with Charging Case (without noise cancelling feature) on a Saturday night along with one other item that I normally get
3151,5.0," The orders arrived Monday afternoon (Labor Day) together in a sealed Amazon box on my doorstep, a day earlier than promised"
3152,5.0, These AirPods are the real Apple (made in Vietnam) product and came sealed in their APPLE certified packaging with warrantee papers (1 year) and instructions
3153,5.0, I paired and tested the AirPods with both my iPhone and my Windows 10 PC - easy to figure out based on the instructions included
3154,5.0," Great high fidelity sound quality and they are so comfortable, I forget about them"
3155,5.0, I walk most days while listening to NPR news radio or Amazon music
3156,5.0, I also watch news and movies on my PC in my room on Apple wired earphones - but I think I'll switch to using the AirPods from now on
3157,5.0, These are perfect for my needs
3158,5.0, And they were offered at a reduced price on Amazon
3159,5.0," Thank you, APPLE"
3160,5.0," Thank you, Amazon"
3161,2.0,Despite my earlier review of these AirPods ; they turned out to be a piece of junk
3162,2.0, I kept having troubles and sent them back into the Apple Repair center
3163,2.0, They returned them with an email message they couldn't find anything wrong
3164,2.0,"but when I received the package back there was in insert stating that they had ""loaded the latest software, checked them out and they should be fine"
3165,2.0," They worked for about 2 weeks, now I'm having the same issues as before in that one pod displays a low charge and the other at 100%, they drop off completely and I have to start the sound over again on my I-Pod"
3166,2.0, I'm really angry and feel like I've been sold a defective product
3167,2.0, So I will have to deal with the repair center again and go thru that merry go round 
3168,2.0, What a real disappointment these things are
3169,2.0," I'm glad I bought a 2 year warranty, but this is really frustrating"
3170,2.0,These airpods are not any good
3171,2.0," First, they DO NOT hold a charge that long"
3172,2.0," The sound quality is terrible, If you have one in and the 2nd one near by, it's constantly switching automatically"
3173,2.0, Unable to hear out of both airpods at the same time either talking or listening to music
3174,2.0," While on a call, you have to damn near scream so that the other person can hear you"
3175,2.0, I'm not pleased at all with these airpods
3176,2.0," Lastly, one of the airpods just stopped working"
3177,2.0," So, this was a bust purchase"
3178,2.0,Lucianno
3179,2.0,"Plano, TX"
3180,4.0,"After buying more than a few less expensive earbuds, both wired and wireless, I finally found a pair that satisfies my intense need for great audio"
3181,4.0, These fit that need
3182,4.0,"I worked in broadcasting for 40 years and used various headphones and speakers every day, so I have great expectations for what audio should sound like"
3183,4.0,"(Yes, I can still hear very well"
3184,4.0,)
3185,4.0,"I was trying to save money with cheaper buds, but I would have saved a good chunk if I just purchased these first"
3186,4.0,"My only issue with these: You don’t want to run or maybe even walk much with these, depending on ear size"
3187,4.0," At 6’1’, I have bigger ears, I guess, and a quick tilt of my head can make at least one fall out"
3188,4.0," Duct tape could probably resolve this issue, though"
3189,4.0,"Bottom line: Great, clear sound"
3190,4.0," Frequency range seems evenly balanced - bass, mid-range and high-end all good"
3191,4.0,Battery life seems good
3192,4.0,Worth the price
3193,2.0,"While initially enamored of my purchase of the Air Pods, I soon discovered that keeping them or one in my ear was uncomfortable"
3194,2.0," I can go for the length of a conversation, but more than that and my ear begins to hurt"
3195,2.0," To be fair, I have small ear canals, so"
3196,2.0," Beyond that, the right AirPod has begun to malfunction, cutting out innumerable times during a conversation despite being fully charged"
3197,2.0, I have to manually change the mode back to AirPod each time
3198,2.0, I also am not so taken with the inability to answer an incoming call with the AirPod
3199,2.0," You can ""tap"" it off, I guess, after finishing the call, but one must hunt down one's phone and manually accept the call for the AirPods to work"
3200,2.0," I had a BlueTooth for years that was seamless in every way: comfortable, convenient, adjustable in sound, -- just the best and then they stopped making them"
3201,2.0," Too good, I guess"
3202,2.0, I tried another kind; it lasted for about a day
3203,2.0," Why do these things always claim to be ""improvements'"" but just prove to be less than the initial"
3204,5.0,Airpods were one of the first earphones to come out that normalized talking to yourself in public
3205,5.0," It use to be something that only those guys on wall street do but now, every body does it"
3206,5.0," Enter COVID, these are a lifesaver"
3207,5.0, I'm tired on signing on Zoom and not being able to hear people properly so I put on these wired headphones but the cords are all tangled up so I'm leaning over my laptop asking the group to give me a minute while I try to effortlessly untangle myself
3208,5.0," In the end, I'm frustrated and given up on untangling so I'm hover a few inches above my laptop because that's the amount of wire I'm able to untangle"
3209,5.0,"Look, there are cheaper ones out there that gets the job done for a fraction of the price if you're willing to ease up on the quality in both build and audio"
3210,5.0," If that's you, go for it"
3211,5.0," If you want decent audio, build that can last being stepped on a few times, and battery life that can last the work day then this is the one for you"
3212,5.0, I have no issues with Airpods thus far and can see myself using it for years to come
3213,1.0,Case wouldn't charge
3214,1.0, I lost my airpods and ordered these to replace my originals
3215,1.0, The airpods easily connected to my phone just as expected
3216,1.0," HOWEVER, the case wouldn't charge"
3217,1.0, I plugged it in and waited for an hour and it never went past 30%
3218,1.0, Just kept the red light on
3219,1.0, I put the new airpods in my old case and they are fine
3220,1.0," I don't want to have to send back the airpods so, even tho the new case won't charge, I'll manage by using my old case"
3221,1.0, Disappointing tho
3222,4.0,These (2nd Generation) AirPods are amazing
3223,4.0, They offer hours of fantastic sound and are a great way to listen to music and jump on a call anytime
3224,4.0," The battery life is pretty solid, giving five hours of listen and talk time"
3225,4.0," When you place them into the case, they will automatically charge very fast allowing up to 24 hours of listening time without having to plug them in"
3226,4.0, The only downside is the terrible noise cancellation
3227,4.0, It does not offer it as a feature in the product however the lack of noise cancellation is very noticeable
3228,4.0," I have also had some issues connecting back to my phone each time but it is very easy to reconnect, so it's not much of a problem"
3229,4.0," Overall, I would say this is a great product and would highly recommend it"
3230,5.0,I was hesitant to purchase airpods as they were a joke for a while that only rich people had them
3231,5.0," But, after going through many cheap pairs of fully wireless earbuds I decided to bite the bullet and purchase airpods"
3232,5.0, Best decision I have ever made when it comes to my mobile audio
3233,5.0, Airpods deliver great sound quality and fit surprisingly well in many different ear types
3234,5.0," If you have an iPhone, these are the only earbuds you should even be considering getting with built-in optimization in iOS"
3235,5.0,I don't know why I put off getting AirPods for so long
3236,5.0, Its just too easy to pop out of the case and throw on an audiobook as I run some errands
3237,5.0, Battery life is pretty poor though
3238,5.0, I was on a discord chat and they lasted for just over 2 hours from a full charge
3239,5.0," Yet, it more than makes up for that in its convenience"
3240,5.0," I would step up to the newer model (wireless case) if it had some real world battery gains, but the time for me considering that has gone and past"
3241,5.0,"Just get a pair, any model will do"
3242,5.0,I hate holding a phone to my head
3243,5.0," The radio waves are doubtlessly bad for us, and it takes away the ability to do anything else needing two hands while I talk on the phone"
3244,5.0," Thus, I was wired until Bluetooth came out, and mostly disappointed until AirPods showed up"
3245,5.0," I bought the original AirPods when they came out, and an inexpensive tether so I had ready access to them when a call came in"
3246,5.0," After more than two years, I somehow lost one of the AirPods and while researching the cost of buying just one, decided to buy Gen 2 instead"
3247,5.0," I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality for calls, music, podcasts and books, is actually quite good"
3248,5.0, As good as my noise canceling Sonys that cost twice as much
3249,5.0,"uh, no"
3250,5.0, As good as they need to be to keep me happy
3251,5.0, Yes
3252,5.0,I don’t understand why there are so many negative reviews
3253,5.0, My husband bought me the same pair that I bought my dad and we love them
3254,5.0," I did buy them when they were more expensive so that sucks but I love how if one falls out your music stops playing, you can listen to music, take phone calls, listen to notifications and so forth"
3255,5.0, The charging case works great
3256,5.0, I usually use them at work for a couple hours listening to podcasts and music
3257,5.0, You don’t have to charge it all the time which I like as well
3258,5.0, I highly recommend this product
3259,5.0, Excellent price now and I would buy them again for others
3260,1.0,Apple is considering the warrenty from the date you ordered and by the time Amazon process it and ships the order its few days (you will be losing a week of so on your warrenty ) 
3261,1.0," Exactly around 1yr time frame our Airpods started giving trouble with low volume after giving run around by both Apple and Amazon, we provided all the proof of receipt etc "
3262,1.0," They told us that they cannot honor the warrenty to get it repaired as they consider the Order date as Warrenty, I wish I would have gove to a physical store to buy "
3263,1.0, Even if Amazon shipped it to you late you will be cheated out of few days so they can get out of providing help 
3264,1.0, Think twice about ordering
3265,2.0,I rushed to buy these here
3266,2.0," I never expected from Apple that they would not charge, or stop charging"
3267,2.0,First just the left one stopped charging then a month later both stopped
3268,2.0,No I did not buy square insurance
3269,2.0, I expected no complications for at lest a year
3270,2.0,I will not buy any MacBooks or iPads that have no headset jacks
3271,2.0,If we are stuck using these they should have been guarantied for two years
3272,2.0,FYI: I never let them charge for more than 20 minutes
3273,2.0, So no overnight
3274,2.0, They never left my house
3275,2.0, No one touched them but me
3276,2.0, They are useless now
3277,2.0,Apple needs to do better
3278,2.0, 
3279,2.0, I like headsets but this was so bd when I only used them twice a week to hear on zoom meetings
3280,2.0, grrrrrr
3281,5.0,I had my reservations about buying AirPods originally
3282,5.0, They were just so small and expensive and I wondered if they even worked that well or if I’d lose them easily
3283,5.0, Luckily those concerns were misguided as I can say they were definitely worth it (for me personally at least) I no longer have to worry about getting tangled in a cord when trying to do things while listening to music/talking on the phone/etc
3284,5.0, and since they’re Bluetooth and have a pretty decent range I can leave my phone in one room of the house while I walk around listening to music from the pods
3285,5.0, They also connect with my Apple Watch and allow me to stream music from there on runs where I’d rather not take my phone
3286,5.0, I’ve gotten so much use out of them I think they were worth it for sure
3287,5.0,I was really hesitant on paying this much for ear buds but after considering I've spent more than this on cheap ones that aren't good I went through with it and I'm quite pleased
3288,5.0, They are tapered so no need for those unbelievably uncomfortable rubber pieces other ear buds have
3289,5.0, They are incredibly comfortable
3290,5.0," I can wear them all day and never miss a beat, versus the thirty minutes tops those ones with rubber pieces that hurt my ears"
3291,5.0," They connect almost instantly, no need to try to pair them or anything like that"
3292,5.0, They sound fantastic and have a surprising amount of bass
3293,5.0, I work construction and I can hear them over the noise at work
3294,5.0, They last a good four hours and fully charge in 15 minutes
3295,2.0,Had to returned after a week because it stopped working
3296,2.0, Purchased another pair in person from an electronic store and I can see the difference and makes me feel this were not the real ones or they were refurbished
3297,5.0,I have to say that I just got these AirPods and I LOVE them
3298,5.0," Just to state my bias upfront: I love Apple products, but I’m not an Apple fanboy"
3299,5.0, Lols
3300,5.0,PROS: The sound quality is fantastic
3301,5.0, I have owned Bose and Jam ultra earbuds
3302,5.0, These are on par with the Bode product
3303,5.0, Though I have never owned the first generation of the AirPods
3304,5.0, I like how easy it is to pair these with my iPhone
3305,5.0, It was so quick and simple
3306,5.0," The Bose and Jam were cumbersome at times, often I would have to unpair and repair them to get them working again"
3307,5.0, No such thing with the AirPods
3308,5.0, I love the small container that stores and charges them
3309,5.0, It just looks and feel nice in your hand too
3310,5.0, The Bose were big and clunky and the Jam Ultra case was huge and made a bulge in my pocket
3311,5.0,CONS: My negatives for the AirPods are small and very trivial
3312,5.0, I wish that they were a little more snug in my ear
3313,5.0, The Bose and Jam earbuds did fit more snugly in my ear hole
3314,5.0, Also with the AirPods it doesn’t give me a battery level status at the top of my phone screen
3315,5.0, See my uploaded picture
3316,5.0, The Bose and Jam Ultra both had a battery level status bar next to the headphone icon at the top of my phone screen
3317,5.0, With the AirPods I have to get the case and open it to get a status of the battery level
3318,5.0," Very insignificant, but it is something"
3319,5.0,I love these AirPods and am extremely happy with them
3320,5.0, I highly recommend these earbuds
3321,5.0,I had been putting off buying a pair of Apple Airpods for a few years now just because I refused to pay so much money for wireless headphones and I bough other brands of ones instead that were much cheaper
3322,5.0," They all sounded terrible and worked just okay, but I finally pulled the trigger on these and I wish I had done it years ago"
3323,5.0, They're great
3324,5.0, They sound pretty good and they just work
3325,5.0, I love that I can make phone calls with them and have Siri at my beck and call whenever I need something
3326,5.0," Also I love that I can use just one at a time, and it can be either the right or left one"
3327,5.0," These are well thought out, as most apple stuff tends to be"
3328,5.0," Only thing I don't love is the battery life, but I guess what do you expect for things so small"
3329,5.0,I don't listen to music with my wireless headphones
3330,5.0, I use them mostly for phone calls and Marco Polo
3331,5.0, I have searched for 2 years for a wireless headset that filters out ambient noise so that the caller on the other end can hear my voice clearly
3332,5.0, My search is now over
3333,5.0, Nothing I've used works better than Apple Airpods
3334,5.0, I don't know how Apple does it but they use some kind of technology that isolates the frequency of your voice and separates it from background noise
3335,5.0, Its truly amazing
3336,5.0, If you're tired of having the person on the other end of a phone call tell you they can't hear you very well because there's too much noise then these are the headphones for you
3337,4.0,"Ok there not Hi-fi, but there pretty darn good"
3338,4.0, I initially bought the AirPods Pro for the noise canceling (I fly a lot)
3339,4.0," However, after using them after several flights, I hated the white noise they produced, as well as, the fit just did not work for me"
3340,4.0, I tried several ear tips but they kept falling out
3341,4.0, That being said the AirPods 2 are great for my ears (no white noise) yes they don’t have active noise canceling but I think the sound great for the price
3342,4.0, They also fit my ears perfectly
3343,4.0, Reason for four stars is that as an Apple product who owns beats I expected better highs and mid-tones
3344,4.0, They do have pretty good base for the size of the ear pod and the sound is not blown out
3345,4.0, Unlike the beats pro
3346,4.0," I also got Apple care via Apple (recommendation: use amazon to buy Apple care, you’ll save yourself a headache trying to get apple to verify your purchase it was about a half hour of work to get apple to override the system and apply the Apple care"
3347,4.0, But they were friendly and did Got it done
3348,4.0,)
3349,2.0,"The Airpods arrived very fast, clean packaging, ez to pair"
3350,2.0, Charged and placed into opn quickly
3351,2.0,I read as many comments as one could stand
3352,2.0," Though very cautious, I leaped in"
3353,2.0,Two most important Airpod features are Sound & Battery
3354,2.0,"If u r lookn to hear without straining, these ARE NOT the product for u"
3355,2.0," No onboard volume adjustments, so phone is dialed up to the max"
3356,2.0, TERRIBLE Audibles
3357,2.0,"Also, the one size fits all earlobs does not work"
3358,2.0,need to add form of clear ear-sleeves
3359,2.0, Battery seems to be good so far
3360,2.0,"Manufacturer, unless they do not work well with certain I-phones (I have a 6+), u should not sell this junk or place a caveat in the description"
3361,2.0, I will try them with my I-ph 7+ & 8 as well
3362,5.0,"It’s 2020, you should know by now that everything Apple is dependable and innovative"
3363,5.0, You have to own a pair to realize all the small and convenient features that Apple packs into their AirPods
3364,5.0, Without going into the settings menu your AirPods are automatically synced just by holding them next to your iPhone
3365,5.0," They stop playing music the second you remove them from your ears, you can customize minor commands with the double tap feature"
3366,5.0, In earphone usually drop out of my ears constantly but these stay in
3367,5.0, The wired earphones that came with my IPhone 11s could not stay in my ears
3368,5.0," I do have to admit that I wish these AirPods had a little more bass and were 10% louder, but with all the other features and conveniences added together these AirPods are still worth 5 stars"
3369,3.0,For clarification I own a Galaxy S10+ but I bought these and the Galaxy Buds
3370,3.0," Sound quality and loudness clearly goes to Galaxy Buds, the airpods just don't do the job"
3371,3.0, I listen to Howard Stern everyday so I need to be able to hear the GOAT
3372,3.0, As for stability (staying in ear) again the Buds have the rubber nipples so they stay put and are comfortable unlike the airpods which after a hour or so leave you with a sharp pain where the edge rest against the inside of your ear
3373,3.0," If your deciding between the two go with Galaxy Buds, there loud, comfortable, stable, and look good too"
3374,1.0,This is one of the purchases where everything that could go wrong did go wrong
3375,1.0,"The first time I purchased the Airpods with the additional AppleCare, I waited anxiously for them to arrive"
3376,1.0, I happened to be at home on the expected day of delivery so I was surprised when I saw the delivery status 'Customer Refused Delivery
3377,1.0,' Nope
3378,1.0, That definitely didn't happen
3379,1.0," I called into Amazon's customer service, who told me, ""Disregard that status message"
3380,1.0, They are Airpods - they probably got stolen
3381,1.0, Things can go missing between the warehouse and delivery
3382,1.0,""" Uh, ok"
3383,1.0," They refunded both the Airpods and the AppleCare, as (THIS IS IMPORTANT) the AppleCare, though sold separately, is connected to the device via the serial number when purchased"
3384,1.0,Cut to my second attempt at purchasing the Airpods and the AppleCare
3385,1.0," I received the Airpods, and like so many others who have purchased them and left reviews, the left Airpod was defective"
3386,1.0, I returned the Airpods and received a refund with no issue
3387,1.0," However, when I inquired with customer service about refunding the AppleCare (because as I mentioned, when purchased, it is associated with the Airpods via serial number), I was told that a one time exception had already been made for me and they couldn't refund it again"
3388,1.0," So, because of what was an issue on Amazon's end initially, I'm now screwed out $29 for the AppleCare purchase when I was sent defective Airpods"
3389,1.0,"If you are willing to buy these Airpods after so many reviewers, including myself, provide feedback stating this product is defective, don't waste your money on the AppleCare"
3390,5.0,I usually wear earbuds on low volume to bed to counter my tinnitus
3391,5.0, It helps me sleep with soothing music
3392,5.0," I started out with wired earbuds, but many times switching positions in bed pulled the cord out of my device, which was not good"
3393,5.0,Now I have these
3394,5.0, I got the 2nd gen because reviews said 3rd gen were less comfortable and looser for some people and I didn't want them falling out as I slept
3395,5.0, They work great
3396,5.0," During the middle of the night, the power gives out, but I'm sound asleep by then"
3397,5.0, They've only fell out of my ears a few times
3398,5.0, The nice thing is that I can switch positions in bed without worrying about the cord
3399,2.0,These more or less sound like the fist gen version
3400,2.0, Like all air pods the battery life and connectivity is great in the beginning and wears down over time
3401,2.0, My 1st gens were all but unusable by the end of their second year
3402,2.0," 45min run time, connection issues, broken microphones etc…"
3403,2.0,The real issue with this version is the range
3404,2.0, These have about half the usable range of the first gens
3405,2.0, I could go anywhere in my house with the 1st gens and not lose my connection
3406,2.0, With these the connection starts to break up when my phone is just one room over
3407,5.0,Let me start with I just switched to the apple world within the last six months
3408,5.0, Macbook and iphone after years of fighting it
3409,5.0," That aside, these things are amazing and work seamlessly when going back and forth between macbook, iphone, car, etc"
3410,5.0, I have been using them for work not that I WFH as a teacher and then enjoy them in the afternoons as well
3411,5.0," Definitely invest in a case right away, I've heard complaints of the case opening up too easily without one plus there are a bunch of fun cases you can get"
3412,5.0, When the charging case is charged these guys charge up in 20 minutes no problem from completely dead
3413,5.0," If you don't have apple products I wouldn't spend the money, but the seamless ability to go between all of your apple stuff is 200% worth it if you are already invested and the sound quality is great"
3414,3.0,Battery life (4 hours) is just long enough for a domestic flight but too short for international flights
3415,3.0, I end up using my full size bluetooth headphones when traveling overseas
3416,3.0,I also worry that they'll fall out of my ears on the plane and get lost in the seats
3417,3.0," Because of this I only use them at home, never outdoors"
3418,3.0,Phone calls are a bit muffled
3419,3.0," Music quality is just above acceptable, not spectacular"
3420,3.0, They pair automatically but sometimes the left or right channel won't come on
3421,3.0,I've mostly gone back to using wired ear buds
3422,5.0,I love my AirPods
3423,5.0," Prior to purchase, I thought it was a total waste of hard earned money and I would not buy them"
3424,5.0, Until I kept losing/breaking my earbuds or headphones
3425,5.0, Then I made the switch
3426,5.0, I am happy to report that I have had my Airpods for almost one year and I am just as in love today as I was a year ago
3427,5.0," They are lightweight, super convenient and functional, and I can't seem to live without them"
3428,5.0, I recommend looking into Apple Care for any and all Apple products that you are considering to buy
3429,5.0," That way, in the event something happens to the item, Apple will replace it for you with little to no questions asked"
3430,5.0," I use these to work out, while I'm at work listening to whatever, or when I'm on the phone"
3431,5.0, The item arrived within two days and the packaging was discreet and left in a secure location on my property
3432,5.0,I never thought wireless AirPods one day could be an object I can’t live without
3433,5.0, We all know many other brands also have such great products
3434,5.0," But I love AirPods just because it is so tiny, invisible, and I get so used to it"
3435,5.0, My ears love it
3436,5.0," I love how free I feel with AirPods and unlike other wireless headphones, it is light and chic just as all those regular AirPods I have over many years"
3437,5.0, This is my second pair as I lost last one somewhere I still couldn’t recall
3438,5.0," And it also made me realized that if I don’t open the case lid, my AirPods would never send out the signals"
3439,5.0, And I could no longer trace it as it clearly outside of the signal range of my phone
3440,3.0,I got issues with this device 
3441,3.0, 
3442,3.0, 
3443,3.0,"The buds are smooth, therefore a bit difficult to grasp when removing from the case"
3444,3.0, There is no kind of cover to keep the buds clean
3445,3.0,"Upon first use, after charging, the phones discharged to 71% after only about a half hour of use"
3446,3.0, Considerably longer on second use
3447,3.0, Volume level ain’t much
3448,3.0, I set it at about 75% to max
3449,3.0, Anything less is useless
3450,3.0,Now the arrogant part 
3451,3.0, 
3452,3.0, 
3453,3.0, buds are NOT “discoverable” under Windows 10
3454,3.0," iPad is, Air Buds are not"
3455,3.0," I can only use these on iPhone, iPad and presumably Mac"
3456,3.0," Does not work in Windows 10 and, I’d bet, Android"
3457,3.0, Other like devices are usable in ALL 3 platforms
3458,3.0, Pretty stupid
3459,3.0,Pros:
3460,3.0,(1) they stay in your ear pretty well
3461,3.0,(2) they are small and light
3462,3.0,(3) they sound pretty good
3463,3.0,Cons:
3464,3.0,Probably the worst battery life of any earbuds on earth
3465,3.0,"I nearly always listen with ONLY 1 earbud in at a time because the other one needs to charge, and I'd rather listen CONTINOUSLY through the day, then have to take both earbuds out and let them charge together"
3466,3.0,Maybe I need a SECOND pair of these so one pair can charge while I'm wearing the other
3467,4.0,To these work well and I like that you can hang up/answer a call by double tapping
3468,4.0, The new pro airpods don't have that feature (or I'm just not knowledgeable of such 
3469,4.0,as I am not tech savvy)
3470,4.0, I orders this pair about a week and half ago to avoid touching my phone to my face for constant contamination (work as PCP NP & if you want a hygiene clue
3471,4.0, cell phones one of dirtiest items we use daily
3472,4.0, So COVID applicable
3473,4.0,"However, they were killing my ears after wearing a short (I am a small person to note); and noise cancellation was like 0…That is a big deal to me"
3474,4.0, I went ahead and took the leap for the new pro pair & OMG AMAZING
3475,4.0, I HONESTLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW GREAT TECH CAN BE
3476,4.0," It literally cuts out sound by at least 80-90% in noise cancellation mode, and with easy tap,"
3477,4.0,off mode or transparency mode
3478,4.0,JUST GET THE NEW AIRPOD PRO
3479,4.0," They are comfortable, yes expensive"
3480,4.0, almost ridiculous but since using I don't regret buying at all
3481,4.0, Now I just have this left over set
3482,1.0,I just took my AirPods I purchased from Amazon in March to the Apple store because of a speaker fault
3483,1.0," I found out that the warranty is tied to when Amazon purchased it, not me"
3484,1.0," So I other words, the new AirPods that would have been in warranty if I bought them from Apple, are out of warranty because Amazon bought them 6 months before I did"
3485,1.0, Awesome
3486,1.0, Didn’t see that in the fine print
3487,5.0,"Good sound, they fit in the ears and do NOT fall out like corded buds"
3488,5.0," The sound is good, but don't expect audiophile level sound"
3489,5.0, You can't expect any better than this from tiny little ear buds
3490,5.0," But the essential element to these are the freedom to walk away from your source with NO wires, nothing"
3491,5.0, The freedom is the charm here
3492,5.0, That and the apple name make this worth the investment
3493,5.0," Sometimes I use these, and other times for real music listening I use full size headphones"
3494,5.0," But for videos, non serious music listening and whatever else, these are great"
3495,5.0," I would say it's better to spend the extra money and get the good stuff, than spend twenty or thirty bucks on some unknown product"
3496,5.0," Expensive, but as all else in life you either buy the real deal or you buy some cheap substitutes"
3497,5.0, Ain't worth it
3498,5.0,It paired effortlessly with my iPhone seven and my older iPad four
3499,5.0,I recommend genuine apple products
3500,2.0,These arrived today and they are definitely not the latest model
3501,2.0, 2nd Generation has “hey Siri” and the charge light is on the outside (front) of the case
3502,2.0, I am sending back and asked for a replacement
3503,2.0, We’ll see if the new ones are the correct version
3504,2.0,Update: Just received the replacement pair
3505,2.0, These are also the Gen 1 airpods
3506,2.0," I am now purchasing directly from Apple, these are NOT the latest model, don't be fooled"
3507,5.0,"Overall the airpods are ok, but they're very expensive when you could easily spend the money elsewhere and get somewhat similar quality bluetooth headphones"
3508,5.0, Not always does the battery life display on your phone or device sometimes i have to open and close the case a few times for the phone and or ipad to be able to see my device
3509,5.0," It doesnt always connect either, thats another thing I dont like about these things"
3510,5.0, Also they can fall out easily from your ears and thats really ridiculous when you're already paying a premium price for the things
3511,5.0, I have a pair of Bluetooth tenergy headphones that are water proof and bluetooth and do not fall out of my ears whatsoever because they have these black arms that wrap around the backs of your ears
3512,5.0, They only costed me like $30 bucks and here im spending much more and they dont even stay in my ears at all
3513,2.0,"These ear pods are wonderful in quality of sound, ease of use"
3514,2.0, I particularly like how you just lift it into your ear and it knows to switch
3515,2.0," I have not figured out how to answer and end a call without having to tap the phone, but haven’t looked it up"
3516,2.0," Tapping the airpod activates the music and switches the song, which is nice, but I have to find out if I can stop music play"
3517,2.0,Downside: Battery life is surprisingly and disappointingly brief
3518,2.0, I used them for a phone call that lasted about 1 1/2 hours
3519,2.0, The buds went dead before the call was finished
3520,2.0,Ears are not one size fits all
3521,2.0, I must be careful when using them or they will fall out of my ear
3522,2.0," Having to pay an additional $100 for the “pro"" model, which is supposed to have adjustable fittings, is a rip off"
3523,2.0," It’s like buying a pair of shoes, advertised at $100"
3524,2.0," “Oh, you want them in YOUR size"
3525,2.0," Well, that will be an additional $100"
3526,2.0,""" So, if purchasing these, beware of the fit"
3527,2.0,I will not recommend these or purchase again
3528,5.0,"I wouldn’t call myself an Apple fanboy but their devices simply work, and do the one thing they are designated to do better than any other of its competitors"
3529,5.0," Now, I am not saying that there aren’t better earpieces but pair of AirPods simply music, style, and beat into one"
3530,5.0, One negative thing about is the fact of noise cancellation being almost none existent
3531,5.0, Especially in the subway when the trains are passing by the only sound you hear is the sound of the train and nothing else despite having the AirPods on
3532,5.0, Apart from noise cancellation AirPods blow away any other earpieces I’ve owned
3533,5.0, With them having discount of 20 bucks I decided to get a pair and they are exactly what I hoped for
3534,5.0, If Apple comes up with a newer model that takes care of the noise cancellation issue I will definitely upgrade
3535,5.0,I bought these for my husband for Father's Day and he loves them
3536,5.0, The sound quality is good as well as the battery life
3537,5.0, These ear pods stay in his ears unlike some others that he has tried
3538,5.0," The price was comparable to other web sites that I tried, but I bought them from Amazon, because of the two day delivery and easy returns in case something went wrong"
3539,5.0, Nothing went wrong and the hubby is happy
3540,4.0,I have to say that I absolutely love the airpods
3541,4.0, They've become an integral part of my life
3542,4.0, I'm on the phone all day at work and so I now just keep these in my pocket to have handy
3543,4.0," They work great for being on the phone, and I prefer them to my car's bluetooth phone system"
3544,4.0, The battery life is phenomenal
3545,4.0, I'm just so glad I made this purchase
3546,4.0,My only complaint is that when I go for a run they do not stay in very well
3547,4.0," It's winter now so I wear a stretch cap over my ears, which keeps them in place"
3548,4.0," However, during warmer weather when I don't wear anything over my ears I've had trouble with them"
3549,4.0, They rarely actually fall from my ears
3550,4.0," However, they generally slide out of place very easily and I have to keep pushing them back in"
3551,1.0,I have been an early adopter of Apple products and have never been disappointed… until the AirPods
3552,1.0, First problem is after I used them only in one ear once
3553,1.0, I then had trouble getting the other AirPod to connect
3554,1.0, I tried everything including removing the device from my Bluetooth list and reinstall
3555,1.0, Still didn’t work
3556,1.0, Second issue is the right AirPod frequently does not charge
3557,1.0, This issues hit about 4 months after I purchased
3558,1.0, I should have returned them but kept thinking it was me
3559,1.0," When my computer programmer son could not get them to work properly, I knew I got a lemon"
3560,1.0, I hear the Pros are better but don’t want to get burned again
3561,1.0, I bought a cheap pair of Edifier buds which work reasonably well and were 25% of the cost of The AirPods
3562,5.0," I was leery of purchasing these based on reviews stating the received used ones but, I am glad I did"
3563,5.0, They arrived still sealed and in original Apple packaging
3564,5.0,I bought these for my 15 year old daughter and she loves them
3565,5.0, They paired easily with her phone She loves the sound quality and they appear to have a good battery life
3566,5.0, She uses her AirPods daily and both sides are still working
3567,2.0,"This is my second pair (I had the first generation Airpods), and they have the same problem: unreliable charging"
3568,2.0," I'll put them in the case, and the orange charging light will come on; I take them out some time later, and one is completely discharged"
3569,2.0," I clean them, and still have problems"
3570,2.0," Also, sometime they don't register in my ear(s): I need to open and shut the case and insert/remove them to/from my ears multiple times"
3571,2.0, I followed Apple's cleaning instructions
3572,2.0, Time for yet another visit to the Apple store
3573,1.0,1
3574,1.0, One pod was muffled while other pod was fine
3575,1.0, Fully charged and tried again
3576,1.0, Independently confirmed faulty pod with different iphones of 20-somethings
3577,1.0,2
3578,1.0, Caked piece of dirt under closed case lid
3579,1.0, Was located both on underside of lid near hinge and the surface where the pods are inserted - in plain sight
3580,1.0, Tried to scrape off but could not
3581,1.0, Packaging was clearly factory from outside to inside
3582,1.0,Between dirt and defective equipment it sure seemed like manufacturer repackaged faulty and/or poor Quality Control
3583,1.0, Not a good look for Mothers Day with family around
3584,1.0, Wife deserves upgrade to noise cancelling
3585,1.0, Returning for replacement
3586,1.0, Hopefully wife gets before school year over (kindergarten teacher using Zoom)
3587,5.0,I held off purchasing these due to their cost
3588,5.0," I tried other knock off brands but now that I have the real ones, I understand what all the hype is about"
3589,5.0, They fit perfectly in your ear
3590,5.0, They pair seamlessly with multiple devices
3591,5.0, They hold a charge
3592,5.0, These are the bomb and well worth the premium price
3593,5.0, The noise cancelling is OK but they really don't advertise that they are noise cancelling so I didn't purchase them with that in mind
3594,5.0, I am amazed that they rarely fall out of my ear so I really don't worry about losing them
3595,5.0," Just put them in the case when not in use - not in your pocket, not on your counter, not in your drink holder"
3596,5.0,you get the picture
3597,5.0, That will only lead to a lost earbud and frustration
3598,5.0, They are great and well worth the price
3599,5.0,"This hear contraptions are white in color, this hear are put on your sound receptacles for listing to sounds"
3600,5.0, You could here better sounds when the volume is up and here less when volume down
3601,5.0," Get your grandkids to beep bop and boop them to you multicellular device, but be careful because I here it gives you blueteeth when you connect without wires, oh it doesn’t contain wires except to charge and recharge and recharge and recharge ever time you need to use the air bud"
3602,5.0,"I just loved that movie, the dog played basketballs and helped the team win, such a feel good movie"
3603,5.0, Oh I think you don’t need them fancy wires to charge your charge or recharge and recharge your air buds
3604,5.0,"the dog wore 23, and jumped and booped the balls with its nose"
3605,5.0," It uses a technology that was created in the mid 80’s to charge, its called Quiff, or Chi, or Tai-chi, but it’s spelled Qi (good luck trying to say it), however that there is a fancy case and it comes at a premium, I think the average cost of rent in low income places around town"
3606,5.0, Anywho
3607,5.0," I see the guys and gals or guygals all over town wearing and harring these things, and just think they are lovely"
3608,5.0," You can have them in any color you want as long as its in white, this seems to be a identifier with Sir Issac Newton’s company"
3609,5.0, You would think with all those colors in the rainbow they would make snazzy fun colors that people could identify with
3610,5.0," I done here they are making a Pro version, maybe Pro is sort for professional and tailored to professionals only, so usens can’t get them, unless you want to mortgage your living establishments"
3611,5.0, One last thing
3612,5.0,you can voice control this air buds
3613,5.0,"I don’t recall if the dog dribbled the balls, because it has no opposable thumbs, and if it did I think the ref would’ve called travel or double drool-ble"
3614,5.0, Hahahaha hahaha
3615,5.0," The servant lady is named Siri and she has to do what you tell her to do, just make sure you yell “Hey Siri” to listen to your commands"
3616,5.0,I absolutely love these Apple AirPods
3617,5.0, I have wanted some since the first generation and finally got a good deal on these on Black Friday
3618,5.0," They are amazing and although I lost one for a couple hours, I would totally recommend them"
3619,5.0, I use one in my ear at all times and especially when I’m driving
3620,5.0, The noise cancellation is awesome and I can hear everything even with just one airpod in
3621,5.0," There especially good with driving because our state is hands-free now, so I don’t have to be afraid of getting a ticket or whatever for Driving and talking on my cell phone"
3622,5.0," Before I got these, I had two or three different cheap sets that I got for about 20 bucks each and every single time they broke"
3623,5.0," These have not broken it all and like I said even though I lost one for a little while, I was able to track it and find it with the find my iPhone app"
3624,5.0, They hooked up to my phone super easily literally I open my iPhone and then open the AirPods case and a little thing popped up on my phone automatically that showed it the battery life of these AirPods and connected them to my phone
3625,5.0, It was very easy to do I never had to go to Bluetooth and do anything fancy I did it automatically on my iPhone
3626,5.0, Totally worth the price in a really great buy and I’m very happy that I got them
3627,5.0," Before I got these, I had two or three different cheap sets that I got for about 20 bucks each and every single time they broke"
3628,5.0," These have not broken it all and like I said even though I lost one for a little while, I was able to track it and find it with the find my iPhone app"
3629,5.0, They hooked up to my phone super easily literally I open my iPhone and then open the AirPods case and a little thing popped up on my phone automatically that showed it the battery life of these AirPods and connected them to my phone
3630,5.0, It was very easy to do I never had to go to Bluetooth and do anything fancy I did it automatically on my iPhone
3631,5.0, Totally worth the price in a really great guy and I’m very happy that I got them
3632,5.0," You can get little cases for them to protect the charging case which I recommend, and you can also get a little cord that you can attach to both of them so that they stay together in your ears and if your ears are too small you can get little adjustments that go over them to make them fit better too"
3633,4.0,I loved my 1st generation airpods but someone broke my car window to steal them so here I am I keep seeing all these reviews about them being fake and they aren’t 2nd generation but all you have to do is go on check coverage-Apple and type in the serial number and it will literally tell you it’s not an amazon site so you know you aren’t being played by amazon :) mine ARE real and they are 2nd generation
3634,4.0,My 4 star rating though~~when I received them they weren’t stuffed with bubble wrap wth why
3635,4.0, That was annoying AND maybe it’s the new model or something but the top that you flip open is so loose like really really wobbly and feels fake or cheap idk why Apple would change that or if it has something to do with the loose top I explained either way real product but not what I was expecting hopefully they work as long as my first pair I got from the Apple store
3636,2.0,I returned these to Amazon after receiving a defective pair of Airpods
3637,2.0, One earbud refused to charge at all
3638,2.0," The other, even when fully charged, was totally hit or miss when it came to pairing with my new iPhone 12 Pro Max"
3639,2.0," Sometimes while I was listening, it unpaired for no reason and refused to re-pair"
3640,2.0," I did not order a replacement pair because, on top of the charging & pairing issues, the hard plastic ear pieces are flat-out uncomfortable"
3641,2.0," Apparently, one has to spring for the top of the line ($$) wireless Airpods to get an earbud that can be adjusted for comfort"
3642,2.0," I went back to my $25 Treblab bluetooth earbuds, which pair effortlessly and fit comfortably into the ear canals with soft silicone covers"
3643,2.0,"PS When the Airpods were working, sound seemed fine, but I listen to podcasts & books so don't know how good they are for music"
3644,5.0,"They're the most reliable wireless earbuds I've come across and you can get applecare with them, which has the best customer service I've come across"
3645,5.0, It was a little uncomfortable at first because I have smaller ears but my left ear got used to them and now it feels like I'm wearing nothing
3646,5.0, They pair seamlessly and you really pay for quality and peace of mind
3647,5.0, I've gotten plenty of knock-off earbuds for way cheaper but they always stop working after a few months
3648,5.0," Now that I have these and the warranty, I know I don't have to go hunting again"
3649,4.0,I bought these for my daughter for her birthday
3650,4.0, Sometime they have a connecting issue but it’s easy to resolve
3651,4.0,They are great headphones
3652,4.0, The sound quality when listening to music is excellent
3653,4.0," Some phone calls are muffled, but most are crystal clear"
3654,4.0, I love That they can detect when they are in your ear and when they are not
3655,4.0, When listening to music my daughter prefers them both in her ear she said it’s not as loud with one
3656,4.0, These also have a locator on them if you lose them they can give off a siren noise to find them
3657,4.0, They do slide out the ear
3658,4.0, It’s annoying to me but my daughter doesn’t seem too bothered by it
3659,4.0, Overall great headphones
3660,4.0, And to answer many questions you can pair your AirPods with other devices
3661,4.0, If you tap your air pods it can answer your phone calls and end them
3662,4.0, If your listening to music and you tap them twice they can switch to the next song
3663,4.0,I bought these to pair with my Android phone
3664,4.0," (I know, they're Apple, but they should pair with any Bluetooth transmitter"
3665,4.0,) They sound really great--good highs and especially good bass for a pair of in-ear headphones
3666,4.0, And I like the way they fit in my ears
3667,4.0," One problem, though"
3668,4.0, The connection tends to break up when my phone and the headphones are moving--like if I'm trying to listen while exercising
3669,4.0," I've read that this doesn't happen with iPhones and has something to do with a slight incompatibility between Apple's ""walled playground"" and the rest of the world's tech"
3670,4.0," I'll keep them because they sound great, but am a bit disappointed about that one thing"
3671,5.0,Bought these as a hands-free with intent to mostly use only one earpiece
3672,5.0," Partly because my ears are clearly a bit different and while right bud sits tight, the other one falls out almost immediately while on the move"
3673,5.0, But the one that doesn't fills like it was made for that ear
3674,5.0," Nice, snug and comfortable"
3675,5.0, It doesn't even make any attempts to fall out
3676,5.0, Almost every aspect is perfect for what they were bought
3677,5.0," Sound quality, distance (from iPhone), battery life, size, weight, ergonomics"
3678,5.0, My only complaint is price ofc
3679,5.0, This can be said about all Apple products
3680,5.0,"Never intended to use them for music for obvious reasons, but I must say I expected them to sound way worse, than they do"
3681,5.0, For an average Joe they sound very decent
3682,5.0," Still if you value sound quality, I would look elsewhere"
3683,5.0, These are clearly not for music enthusiasts
3684,5.0,Bottom line
3685,5.0," If you need earbuds for your iPhone mostly for the phone calls and occasionally to listen the music, look no further"
3686,5.0," Taken they will hold in your ears nice an snug, which I suggest you to find out before buying them"
3687,5.0,AirPods are great
3688,5.0, These do not have noise cancellation and there are definitely headphones with better sound quality but the ease of use and battery is unmatched
3689,5.0, These connect to just about everything and it is so easy to just carry around and pull them out when you need
3690,5.0," I use them with my tv, phone, iPad"
3691,5.0, I bought one for everyone in my family from Black Friday and we all have been loving them these past months
3692,5.0, They automatically connect to my phone but if I need I can easily switch to my iPad and laptop within seconds
3693,5.0, It’s also great that two different AirPods can connect to one phone like if my gf and I want to listen to the same music
3694,5.0, The battery life is a couple hours long and you can fully charge them in the case for less than 20 min
3695,5.0, They last more than a day so all you have to do is remember to charge the case every couple days
3696,5.0, My only personal problem with them is the case is so small
3697,5.0, You definitely need a rubber cover or something because its slippery
3698,4.0,I really like the function and sound
3699,4.0, I love to wear while floating in the pool or working in the kitchen
3700,4.0, What I don't like is the comfort or lack of
3701,4.0, I had some less expensive ear pods with a cushion that were really comfortable but didn't work
3702,4.0, Now I can't find the vendor on Amazon
3703,4.0, I usually only wear the left pod and don't put it very far into my ear due to the comfort
3704,4.0, Wish I could afford the AirPodPro but fighting cancer is expensive and I just can't spend that much
3705,5.0,I bought these to use at work instead of my over the ear beats because wearing those huge headphones isn’t a great look at work
3706,5.0," I wasn’t expecting them to sound amazing, but the sound quality is comparable to my beats that were 3x the price"
3707,5.0, They are definitely by apple; I’ve watched enough YouTube videos to be able to spot fakes
3708,5.0, Mine are definitely 1st gen
3709,5.0, This is how you can tell:
3710,5.0,"If the picture on the back of the box includes the charger, it is 1st gen"
3711,5.0, The 2nd gen AirPod box doesn’t feature a picture of the charging cable on the back; all you’d see are the AirPods in their case
3712,5.0," The 2nd gen case also has a tiny little dot on the front, a light that turns on when the case is charging wirelessly"
3713,5.0," The 1st gen case does not have that feature, so, of course, there’s no light on the front"
3714,5.0,"But seriously, that’s the only feature you’re missing out on, other than maybe some better sound quality that you won’t really miss unless you’ve used 2nd gens before"
3715,5.0," Again, these are really great"
3716,5.0,I know I’ve tried every wireless headphone there is on the market
3717,5.0, I could not talk on the phone clearly with any of them
3718,5.0, I was about to give up when the guy at the nail salon told me about these
3719,5.0, At this point I’d spent so much on the cheap ones that I decided to “invest” in these
3720,5.0, I’m SOOOOO happy with them and they’re well worth the investment
3721,5.0, The people on the other end of my phone say they can hear me better than speaker and the Bluetooth in my car
3722,5.0, After I raved about them constantly to my family they have all bought a pair
3723,5.0, Even my mother in law bought a pair
3724,5.0," Now, we’re all picking out our waterproof and AirPod cases"
3725,5.0,"Was planning on getting the pros for better sound & noise cancellation, but opted for the deal going for Airpods 2"
3726,5.0," Sound is loud and clear and battery life is never an issue, I’m pretty active most the day and when I do need to use airpods the battery life failing on me isn’t a problem"
3727,5.0, Using AirPods 2 for calls is smooth and listening is very audible
3728,5.0," They’re just like the wired earpods when it comes to fit, but feel slightly better and since it’s wireless you don’t gotta worry about snagging onto things and falling out"
3729,5.0, I do weight lifting and jogging on the treatmill at the gym and with light cardio and they fit decent
3730,5.0, Just plant em’ in your ear tight and you should be good
3731,5.0," Flaws I could say is the fit may not be that great when doing heavy cardio workouts, so I’d recommend some ear tips for the basic airpods, Pros of course are naturally gonna fit better"
3732,5.0,"TL:DR - Overall sound is good, battery life is good, and fit is decent"
3733,5.0, I got for $129 plus taxes & fees and highly recommend for someone looking to flex with airpods without shelling out too much and a good sounding pair of bluetooth audio devices
3734,5.0,This is the second time I’ve bought these air pods
3735,5.0, I love them
3736,5.0, Very good quality and comfortable
3737,5.0, They fit my ears very well snd don’t fall out
3738,5.0, The price was also very reasonable for the quality
3739,5.0, It came in nice sealed box and brand new
3740,5.0, The battery lasts really long on the case
3741,5.0, I don’t charge it every day
3742,5.0, Depends on how much I use them but can generally go a few days without charging case
3743,5.0, When wearing these I can pretty much hear when someone talks to me yet they are good enough that I can hear what I’m listening even if someone in room is watching tv
3744,5.0, To me I would not want 100% noise cancelling because that doesn’t seem safe to me
3745,5.0, I like that I can control them on the pod itself or my phone
3746,5.0, I’m very pleased with my purchase and would buy them a third time if needed
3747,5.0, I feel no need to buy newer air pods with very little features I don’t get with these
3748,5.0, I recommend to my brother and he bought some fir himself and our mother and they love them as well
3749,5.0, My son also has them and is very happy with them
3750,5.0, Highly recommend these
3751,5.0, The price is half what the newest air pods are but the quality is not
3752,5.0, Excellent quality and price
3753,5.0,"Let me start by saying I don’t like apple products typically and I think their marketing, product cycles and etc are not great"
3754,5.0,"My feelings on the company aside, this product is genuinely very good"
3755,5.0," It has a long battery life, the charging case is well made and the earbuds click in and top closes with magnets so they don’t fall out or get lost easily"
3756,5.0, The case also serves as a portable battery pack for the headphones and it can be recharged with a standard iPhone charger
3757,5.0, The headphones detects when you pull them out of your ears and pauses whatever you’re listening to and restarts when you put them back in and automatically connects to your phone
3758,5.0, The noise cancelation isn’t so much I feature I look for but at medium to louder volumes you can’t hear things around you but at quiter volumes you can hear everything around you if that makes any difference
3759,5.0, I normally don’t like iPhone headphones in general because they’re a bit big and don’t fit comfortably but these fit perfectly plus they’re small and inconspicuous
3760,5.0,"I bought a ton of other headphones but they all died, broke or were a pain to connect or charge"
3761,5.0,These headphones were overly expensive but they are better in every way and I fully recommend them
3762,5.0,These have been reviewed so many times I can’t really add anything new
3763,5.0, If you like the wired Apple EarPods you will probably like these
3764,5.0, They have a similar fit but more secure without the wires tugging on them
3765,5.0, The sound is neutral and a little better than EarPods
3766,5.0," The design allows you to hear what’s going on around you, which is important to me"
3767,5.0, Helps me not get run over while walking the dog
3768,5.0," When I want a more immersive experience, listening to music in a comfy chair, I use large over ear headphones"
3769,5.0,Part of a review has to be based on value
3770,5.0, I payed $115 and used a credit card that extends the warranty from 1 to 3 years
3771,5.0, That made these a good value for me personally
3772,5.0, Keep in mind that these can’t be repaired in any way
3773,5.0, A “Battery Service” from Apple is just buying a new one
3774,4.0,I bought the Gen 1 AirPods when they came out back in 2016 and used it for two years before the batteries gave out
3775,4.0, I then experimented with other brands and used the Jabra Elite 65t/75t and even a budget AUKEY one
3776,4.0," While they were all decent and arguably sounded better for music, if your main purpose is to listen to podcasts and take calls on your earbuds, nothing beats Apple; esp"
3777,4.0, if you have an iPhone and/or Mac
3778,4.0,The connection stability of these is second to none
3779,4.0," Other Bluetooth earbuds struggle to maintain connection with my Mac and the Jabras outright don't support Macs (at least not officially, so they won't help you if you run into issues)"
3780,4.0," These aren't the best sounding, but by God they are the most easy to use and simply get out of the way"
3781,5.0,I have gone through several brands of true wireless ear buds
3782,5.0, There are some with super stereo sound and long battery life but such on phone calls because they pick up every noise within 100 feet
3783,5.0,"After experiencing that, I have found that Apple air buds are the best"
3784,5.0, Battery life isn’t super long but there are so many other features that compensate for that
3785,5.0," Ease of connection, automatic shut off when removed from your ears"
3786,5.0,etc
3787,5.0, I could go on and on but really don’t have the time
3788,5.0, I will end with this though
3789,5.0, Apple air pods are a superior product and I still can’t believe how much I enjoy them
3790,5.0, Don’t be fooled by imitations and knock offs
3791,5.0,I regret having waited so long to purchase mine
3792,5.0,Good quality has some basic features you can customize in settings
3793,5.0, Skipping tracks or pausing the music and a few others just by double clicking what ear pod you have the settings for
3794,5.0, Connects instantly
3795,5.0, You can’t change the volume on it without pulling out your device unfortunately
3796,5.0, In my opinion it’s a tad over priced
3797,5.0, If you want them I personally wouldn’t pay more than $70
3798,5.0, Only reason I got them was because I had gift cards that covered most of the cost so I really only paid like $40 Or so for them
3799,5.0, Overall is it worth money not really definitely cheaper options that are probably the same quality in all honestly
3800,5.0, If you are heart set on Apple products these are the best option
3801,5.0, This is the OG one but personally I would get these over the new ones less to go wrong
3802,5.0, Again only if you heart set on Apple if not get the like 30-50 dollar ones will be just about the same quality and features as these
3803,5.0," Also buy the case with something to attach to like a purse, backpack or, pants definitely something you can lose if you travel a lot"
3804,5.0, They do appear in find my iPhone app but if they haven’t been used it will just show the last location
3805,5.0, So someone would have to use them to keep the location up to date
3806,5.0, Again you have to decide if this product works for you and is worth your money personally if you don’t care if it’s Apple get the cheaper one if you can’t buy non Apple these are the best ones that you can get without spending a crazy amount of money
3807,5.0, Side note don’t buy them used
3808,5.0, Used ones usually have issues that Apple won’t cover unless you buy Apple care so unless you want to buy Apple care on used ones just buy them new
3809,5.0,"If I could befriend headphones, these would be the ones"
3810,5.0," They're intuitive, easy to use, sound great, and worth the price now that I've had them a year and go nowhere without them"
3811,5.0, I usually use one at a time so I can still hear around me and save on battery
3812,5.0," I've rarely dropped, but the couple of times I have, they've been just fine"
3813,5.0," I love how easy they are to use with iPhone, MacBook, iMac"
3814,5.0, They charge fast
3815,5.0," I've not tried the pros, don't see any reason at this time because these fit comfortably and are so amazing"
3816,5.0," I tried knock offs twice before these and am so glad I dropped that nonsense and bit the bullet on these higher priced, but oh so superior, headphones"
3817,5.0, I didn't think wires were a big deal until I moved to these and then tried to use the wired headphones once
3818,5.0, Yuk
3819,5.0, Almost pulled my MacBook right off the table
3820,5.0, Goof
3821,5.0, The case is slippery smooth; I would absolutely recommend a case of choice (I have Spongebob)
3822,5.0, Enjoy
3823,3.0,"Really like them when they work, only had them two months but the three times now the left one did not connect, have had to plug them in to charge and that seems to reset it, one time both went off even though they said connected so I choose “forget this device” then connected again"
3824,3.0," That’s a lot to go wrong in two months, especially because they haven’t been used every day or even for more than 8 hrs at any given day"
3825,3.0, Disappointing but I guess I only paid $135 so not premium price
3826,3.0, Didn’t want the newest ones as that style doesn’t fit my ears comfortably
3827,3.0,I own a Pixel 2XL for personal but have an iPhone 8 for business as does my wife
3828,3.0," I ordered the Air Pods 1) because they were on sales and, 2) for business calls expecting high end quality as Apple is known for"
3829,3.0," First, the quality build of the product is excellent"
3830,3.0, They connect easily to Bluetooth and I must say I found the sound quality better than expected
3831,3.0," However, the lack of a rubberized ""ear piece"" causes them to sit on the ear rather than in it"
3832,3.0, This diminishes noise cancellation
3833,3.0," It also feels like they will fall out if I move around too much but admittedly, that is a personal preference and based on my ear ""anatomy"""
3834,3.0, What surprised me most (and disappointed) was the short battery life compared to other non-Apple ear pods I have owned
3835,3.0, The specs say 5-hours (which is short to begin with) but tests reviews I have read say 4
3836,3.0,2 hours at best
3837,3.0, Not for me
3838,3.0, I'm barely getting 3-hours
3839,3.0," So for someone who is constantly on conference calls, I'm forced to switch back to the wired ear pods"
3840,3.0, And when one considers what Apple charges $159
3841,3.0,"00 plus (when not on sale) for this and all its products, the value just isn't there"
3842,3.0," Unless you are an Apple fanatic, there are better wireless ear pods on the market that offer a better value"
3843,5.0,I love this product and I use it every day
3844,5.0, For work I answer phone calls and I am very happy with the quality of both the sound I hear and the clarity of my voice to the people I talk to
3845,5.0, I often listen to audible books on tape while walking or running and it is very easy to use
3846,5.0, I prefer these to the more expensive product offered by Apple because it does not cancel all the external sound
3847,5.0, I think it is safer to be able to hear adequately the sounds around you
3848,5.0, Especially when exercising out side
3849,5.0, Your hearing can save your life from unexpected hazards like cars or bikes coming down the road
3850,5.0, The sound quality is excellent
3851,5.0,Love these
3852,5.0,Bought multiple sets for the entire family
3853,5.0, The sound quality of the 2nd generation airpods has certainly improved from the 1st generation
3854,5.0," The sound is still crisp, but the ""bass"" is greatly enhanced"
3855,5.0, This brings the new generation nearly up to the five-star level of earbuds like the $300 Stennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2
3856,5.0,Apple's airpods aren't built for complete noise cancellation
3857,5.0," Although the ear-form shape of Apple's airpods help prohibit background noise somewhat, if you're looking for complete noise cancellation you'd be better served looking for earbuds designed for that purpose, like the $228 Sony WF-1000XM3"
3858,5.0," However, if you're like me and don't mind simply upping the volume a notch or two, Apple airpods will do just fine"
3859,5.0,The contoured shape has another benefit: the airpods stay in very well while doing activites
3860,5.0," I took them for a run with no issues, and played a little basketball and only had to readjust them a couple times"
3861,5.0,"The battery life of Apple's airpods is as good as advertised, giving close to five hours of music playback in my test"
3862,5.0," Unless you're going for multiple marathons per day, they will more than suffice"
3863,5.0,The hallmark of airpods are their convenience
3864,5.0, They automatically pair with your phone as soon as you open your case
3865,5.0," The case, by the way, is as smooth and chic as it looks"
3866,5.0," The pods are touch controllable, meaning you can skip, rewind change volume, and control calls all with a tap"
3867,5.0," The call quality is great as well, almost better than an actual phone"
3868,5.0,"In summary, for the fine-tuned product that Apple airpods are, the price is a bargain"
3869,2.0,I finally decided to get AirPods because I’ve heard more positive reviews than negative
3870,2.0, Unfortunately I wish I would have listened to more of the negative reviews because I’m having the same issues
3871,2.0, My AirPods will randomly stop playing my music and it takes me forever (sometimes more than 30 minutes) to get them to work again
3872,2.0, I have started working out with my basic headphones again because 2 different days this week I couldn’t listen to my music during my workout
3873,2.0, That’s the main reason I bought them so they will just collect dust now because i returning things is such a hassle now
3874,2.0," My advice, stick with the cord headphones"
3875,5.0,Amazing
3876,5.0, Worth the money
3877,5.0, I was on the fence of getting the new AirPod Pros or the AirPod 2nd Generation
3878,5.0, I’m glad I went with the 2nd Gen AirPods
3879,5.0, They are extremely comfortable
3880,5.0, Sometime I forget they’re in (no bull
3881,5.0,)
3882,5.0, It connects so seamlessly to my iPhone and feels like it belongs
3883,5.0, I tried the Jabras
3884,5.0, uncomfortable and no touchless “Hey Siri”
3885,5.0, This even reads messages to you or can annouce who’s calling by tweaking some of your General Settings
3886,5.0, I use them everyday
3887,5.0," Start my morning with Youtube and Apple News updates, make calls, listen to music while working"
3888,5.0, They seem expensive but it’s worth the money
3889,5.0, I also like that they don’t cancel out all of the noise and also work independently (I usually only have one in)
3890,5.0," However, when I really want full sound for music, I put both in and can barely hear the wind and road noise, on the highway, with the windows down"
3891,5.0, Good job Apple
3892,4.0,"I've never owned Airpods, thisbis my first time"
3893,4.0, I came back to the site to do a review and decided to read through some of the others
3894,4.0,long story short this led to me looking at each earpiece under a magnifier
3895,4.0, Mine came brand new in shrink wrapped box however the left pod is gen 1 and the right is gen 2 (according to the model numbers)
3896,4.0,When I take 1 out it still plays music
3897,4.0," Idk if that normal or not be I've never had airpods before, plus I'm using them with android galaxy"
3898,4.0, Other than that I haven't had any real issues with them
3899,4.0,Decided not to ask for a replacement though
3900,4.0,I wouldn't want to end up with some terrible/used/dirty ones
3901,5.0,Compre los airpods porque necesitaba unos audifonos inalambricos porque son muy funcionales
3902,5.0," Sin embargo, me ha pasado:"
3903,5.0,Cons:
3904,5.0,1
3905,5.0, No lo logro conectar mis airpods con mi macbook air por medio de bluetooth
3906,5.0, Se conectan y al segundo se desconectan
3907,5.0, Me tocara mirar videos en youtube para poder arreglar el problema
3908,5.0,2
3909,5.0, El audifono derecho molesta mucho cuando hablo por telefono
3910,5.0, Se oye como un ruido muy raro que molesta mucho
3911,5.0, Ya me ha pasado varias veces en un periodo corto entonces los llevare al servicio tecnico en la tienda Apple
3912,5.0,Pros:
3913,5.0,1
3914,5.0, Son demasiado funcionales
3915,5.0, Me los pongo y puedo hacer muchas actividades sin tener el cable regular de los audifonos pegado al celular y tener que llevar los dos de la mano
3916,5.0,2
3917,5.0, Se acomodan al oido muy bien
3918,5.0, No he tenido ningun problema con que se me caigan mientras camino
3919,5.0, No los he usado mientras corro
3920,5.0,3
3921,5.0, Son lo mejor cuando quiero hablar por telefono u oir musica y al mismo tiempo tengo que cargar mi celular
3922,5.0, Antes cuando usaba los audifonos de cable tenia que usarlos o cargar mi celular
3923,5.0, Ahora puedo hacer los dos al tiempo sin ningun problema
3924,2.0,"So disappointed in these second generation Apple Airpods that I bought as a gift, the recipient could not use them (bad fit, volume control issues) so I tried them"
3925,2.0,"They do not sit well in the ear, they are advertised for use during sports, among other things, but are really poorly thought out , the Airpods frequently fall out making them unsuitable for cycling"
3926,2.0," They leak sound really badly , making them unsuitable for use around other people or in quiet locations"
3927,2.0, The battery life is terrible at 1-2 hours
3928,2.0," The sound quality is OK, on a par with earphones like the ones airlines give away"
3929,2.0,Definitely not worth the price and to top it all Apple appear to be limiting the compatibility with other wearables (or are doing something with licensing fees) for example the Airpods do not work with Fitbit Versa devices (no volume control) 
3930,2.0, Even with the iphone there is no way to adjust the volume without getting out the phone or invoking Siri
3931,2.0," Just imaging having to say ,hey Siri turn the volume up/down during a flight or similar"
3932,2.0,"Purchased a set of TaoTronics bluetooth headphones, better fit, battery, have a volume control and work with the fitbit Versa, oh and a fraction of the price"
3933,2.0,Loved everything except for the fit
3934,2.0," No matter how hard I tried, even looking at Youtube videos and others' comments, they would not stay in my ears"
3935,2.0, I even bought silicon covers but they still fell out
3936,2.0, Unfortunately had to return
3937,2.0, Would be great if Apple made some type of adapter to enable more ear sizes/types to work
3938,1.0,"Due to the pandemic i am self-isolated, so decided to buy a present online for my wife"
3939,1.0, i decided to make a purchase online
3940,1.0, However i encountered with some unpleasant snags
3941,1.0," First of all, the parcel arrived after a month, moreover it was with a technical fault, particularly it makes some weird buzzing sound in one ear, that is annoying indeed"
3942,1.0, It’s an awful experience
3943,1.0, I am really concerned
3944,1.0,amazon customer care was not helpful at all
3945,1.0, returning item costs me about half the cost of the item
3946,1.0, i strongly advise you not to buy if you do not live in the USA
3947,1.0, you will waste money
3948,3.0,"I really, really wanted to love these"
3949,3.0, The case the earbuds come in is very compact & very easy to travel with
3950,3.0,"That being said, they will not stay in my ears"
3951,3.0," I needed to make sure that if I was moving around semi fast like just using a stair stepper that they would stay in my ears, they don’t"
3952,3.0," I simply bent over to pick up an item I had dropped, the right one fell out"
3953,3.0,"I could never got the noise cancellation because these buds were too loose; and on that same thread, I never really had the chance to hear the great sound, because again, they were super loose & would not stay in my ears"
3954,3.0,Back to the drawing board in finding Great ear buds
3955,3.0," If anyone that reads this has any suggestions, please let me know"
3956,4.0,I like these better than the buds I bought that fit in the ear
3957,4.0, Those always fell out and started to hurt after about 20 minutes of use
3958,4.0, These sound great and don't fall out
3959,4.0," HOWEVER, I'm having pairing issues with my iphone/watch"
3960,4.0, The sound doesn't always come through the headphones after connecting to my phone
3961,4.0, I have to stop and start several times to get it to go through the headphones
3962,4.0," Then if I pause and start again using my watch, I have to do the whole process of switching sound back to headphones"
3963,4.0, I'm not sure what is happening
3964,4.0, I'm sure I'll figure it out
3965,4.0," I haven't had that issue with my ipad, so I'm sure it's something to do with the phone and watch working together"
3966,4.0," Overall, these fit in my ear better than Echo Buds, the sound quality is good, but it's lacking noise cancelling"
3967,4.0, I just didn't think it was worth $100 to go up to the Pros for that
3968,5.0,"Music is my game, and I love to listen to my favorite music on a high noise level"
3969,5.0," No worries about bothering the neighbors, now"
3970,5.0," I purchased these from Amazon at a one time discount, a little nervous that I would not receive the quality"
3971,5.0," No worries, noise cancellation, perfect, quality of sound, excellent, ease of use , very easy"
3972,5.0,These arrived in a tight pa kati g as all of App'e products do
3973,5.0," Once I got in and read the directions, it was very easy"
3974,5.0," The pods were at different levels of battery life,so I plugged them in"
3975,5.0, Both at 100% within a short period of time
3976,5.0," The bBluetooth was turned on, instantly the ear pics were connected"
3977,5.0," I put them in my ears, and started listening to the new Rufus Wainwright’s CD, ‘Unfollw The Rules’"
3978,5.0, Beautiful music and Rufus’s voice came through
3979,5.0, I am quite happy with these ear pods
3980,5.0,Recommended
3981,5.0, prisrob 07-31-2020
3982,3.0,"typical apple quality, these airpods are of excellent build and sound"
3983,3.0," they perform equally well as the corded version, of course without the cord"
3984,3.0," but the only advantage i found was the lack of cord, not enough benefit to justify the $160 price tag"
3985,3.0, but i could justify the returning them and that's exactly what i did
3986,3.0, i guess i'll just stay with my corded apple ear buds - and I get to keep the extra $160
3987,3.0,UPDATE November12: i bought a second pair of these airpods recently thinking maybe i didn't give the first pair enough time to grow on me
3988,3.0," i took them on a cycling trip and was reminded why i returned them in the first place: whenever i wanted to change the volume, i had to reach behind in the jersey and make the changes through my iPhone"
3989,3.0, what a nuisance
3990,3.0, i'm glad i returned them
3991,3.0, in addition these pods do not pair automatically between a MacBook and iPhone like they do with the watch
3992,3.0, they must be reconnected between the two each time you change devices
3993,3.0, just could not justify the cost with those drawbacks
3994,5.0,These are very light
3995,5.0, It's hard to imagine how some find these uncomfortable since they don't weigh anything
3996,5.0, I wore one while working and with plenty of background noise and I could hear the airpod loud and clear
3997,5.0, I also used with the Apple Watch w/cellular and that combo is excellent as well
3998,5.0, I haven't ran one dead yet but I don't listen to music all day long either
3999,5.0, The charging case really would fix and battery concerns though
4000,5.0, As far as music goes there's not really any bass
4001,5.0, It still sounds great
4002,5.0, I can't say whether any other ear buds are better though so may not be an issue
4003,5.0, They do seem to stay in the ear for all activities
4004,5.0, If you are wearing them under a helmet or hoodie (like I do) they can get pulled loose but I wouldn't worry about it falling out otherwise
4005,1.0,After a week the AirPods kept disconnecting from my iPhone 7
4006,1.0, I had to have the device leave Bluetooth and completely restart
4007,1.0," Before that, the left side would play music but it would not respond to the double tap nor to the motion to automatically start the AirPods/turn Them off when taken out of the ear"
4008,1.0," I will return and re-order, give it another try since I really like them aside from this issue"
4009,1.0,Update receiving my replacement AirPods: I want to start by saying I am fairly text savvy and know how to work with my iPhone having used other Bluetooth devices with it
4010,1.0, This new set of AirPods still has issues with consistency: it can take forever for the AirPods to link up with my phone
4011,1.0, The tap modes such as pause and fast forward work infrequently
4012,1.0," It is hard to believe that there is a single digit percentage of problems like these on all of the reviews that I see, because this is my SECOND pair and I am still having issues"
4013,1.0," I can get by without having to use the double tap modes, I can just use my phone, but the delayed wireless hook up to the phone is just unacceptable"
4014,1.0, Since I have tried other brands of wireless these seem to have the best sound and are the most comfortable
4015,1.0," But if you don’t mind using a different wireless buds that stick directly in your ear, then skip apple and get those"
4016,1.0,So disappointed but keeping them anyway
4017,5.0,These Apple Airpods are great for listening while you are active doing other things
4018,5.0, I was reluctant to order the AirPods because I had doubts that they would stay in my ears
4019,5.0," So far, that has not been a problem"
4020,5.0, I am still somewhat paranoid that one will fall out of my ear and I will fail to notice
4021,5.0," That concern is somewhat reduced because if one should fall out, they both stop working"
4022,5.0, I ought to be able to notice that
4023,5.0," Sound quality is not great, but good enough to wear while you're at the gym or merely walking around"
4024,5.0, Some degree of noise cancellation is achieved by the pods blocking the ear canal
4025,5.0, I would not want active cancellation because I want awareness of what is happening around me
4026,5.0, I haven't taken note of the battery life because I recharge the case after each use of the pods
4027,1.0,These are not the second generation they are the first
4028,5.0,I mean they’re Apple so you know the sound quality is there
4029,5.0, It’s very freeing to have Bluetooth headphones and they’re pretty comfortable
4030,5.0,I had to give it a low rating on the battery life just because plenty of Bluetooth headphones come with an extremely long battery life (I’ve had Beats headphones that boast a 24-48 hr battery) and it’s a little disappointing given that Apple is a very well established company
4031,5.0,I also checked the serial number of my pods and the validity of the warranty on Apple’s website
4032,5.0, I can confirm that I received real AirPods
4033,5.0, I would suggest anyone who is uncertain about buying from Amazon due to authenticity just make sure you’re not buying third party and check the serial number on Apples website so if you receive fakes you can get Amazon support on it right away
4034,5.0, Serial number is located on the inside-top-left of the case
4035,5.0,Ones I got were authentic
4036,5.0, Ordered during prime days and received same day
4037,5.0, Gotta love amazons ability to satisfy instant gratification
4038,5.0, Read some reviews stating the items received were replicas
4039,5.0, I compared my current working pair I purchased directly through apple 06/2020 to the ones from amazon and they look and sound authentic
4040,5.0, I wouldn't have purchased from amazon had I not had an authentic item to compare it to in hand already
4041,3.0,I decided to buy a airpod given all the hype around it
4042,3.0, The best thing about this earphone is how easy it pairs with your iphone
4043,3.0, And it automatically connects to it when you take it out from the charging case
4044,3.0," However, the noise cancellation is not at par of this price point and the battery doesn't last long enough"
4045,3.0," Given the high price point, I really could only give this product three stars"
4046,5.0,Great deal
4047,5.0," Very simple set up, it’s done automatically for you as soon as you turn on Bluetooth"
4048,5.0, Small footprint to carry and store
4049,5.0, Just received yesterday so I’m looking at battery life today and will come back to update
4050,5.0, Comfortable to wear and feels secure in my ears which I ALWAYS have a problem with earphones staying in place just staying still
4051,5.0, It’s quite nice to not worry about that anymore
4052,5.0," I also bought a great pouch with a silicone case, ear fitters, lanyard that attaches to to pods, wristband pod holder with a nice zip case with a clip to house it all"
4053,5.0, So I’m set and very happy with my purchases
4054,5.0,My son got these for me for Christmas
4055,5.0, My phone picked them up instanly
4056,5.0," I didn't have to do anything to ""hook them up"""
4057,5.0, I registered them on the apple site and then googled how to use them
4058,5.0, Well they are quite easy to use
4059,5.0, I adjusted the settings for my right and left ear
4060,5.0, I have had them in for hours and I forgot they were in
4061,5.0, Now I understand why people walk around with them in their ears 24/7
4062,5.0, I was also shocked to hear my incoming text read to me while I was wearing them
4063,5.0, Wow
4064,5.0," My husband is a tractor trailor driver, I will be getting him some for the sole reason of the text reading"
4065,5.0, I fully understand that I am 5 years behind the times but this review is for other middle aged people who have no idea what ipods are
4066,5.0,"I have to admit, I have been an Apple product hold out for years"
4067,5.0, I owned an i4S phone a long time ago and avoided Apple altogether
4068,5.0, I owned upwards of a dozen other BT earbuds and thought i knew what quality was
4069,5.0, I was wrong
4070,5.0, I am impressed at both the voice clarity and battery life
4071,5.0, There is no comparison
4072,5.0, My daily commute can be 2 hours each way and I drive with them in enjoying my conversation
4073,5.0," What I truly didn't expect but have a lot of respect for is when I drive with the window down, the person on the other end of the phone doesn't comment, doesn't complain about disturbance"
4074,5.0, Rock on
4075,5.0, Finally I can retire the others and use this
4076,5.0,I got these as a gift from my daughters and could not be happier
4077,5.0, The sound quality is great
4078,5.0," I use them for phone hands free driving, multi tasking while on the phone, work calls etc"
4079,5.0, as well as for music
4080,5.0, They sound great and the feedback from other callers is excellent as far as how I sound
4081,5.0, I can hear the caller and my music perfectly and they have great dynamic range for music
4082,5.0, The noise cancellation issue is a trade off that I rated fairly at a 3 but that is not a negative
4083,5.0, These fit loosely so that makes them extremely comfortable to wear and just about forget they're on for long periods of time
4084,5.0," However, the fact that they are loose fitting does allow other noise to enter"
4085,5.0," This is a positive if you are in the car, have other people that may speak to you from time to time while you're wearing them etc"
4086,5.0, To me these are a great balance
4087,5.0, I have another brand that I've had for years that fit really tightly and while they block out ambient noise they're also less comfortable and it's really hard to have them on while other people are around or you're needing to hear anything at all except the headphones
4088,5.0, To me this is a great balance and I am extremely pleased with these
4089,4.0,"Extraordinarily comfortable, since they rest in your ears rather than stick inside them like other true wireless earbuds with rubber tips"
4090,4.0,"Super easy to pair across all devices, including Android phones and Windows PCs"
4091,4.0, Other premium brands seem to only focus on pairing with smartphones and have spotty pairing performance with other devices like laptops
4092,4.0,"The sound quality is very good, better than anything I've tried except, of course, for full over-ear headphones"
4093,4.0, These even sound better than other premium brand's true wireless earbuds that cost $100 more and have better on-paper specs
4094,4.0," (Looking at you, Sony WF-1000XM3s"
4095,4.0,)
4096,4.0,The only downside is the microphone performance on phone calls is very much hit or miss
4097,4.0, I often have to turn off bluetooth and hold the phone up to my ear old-fashion-style
4098,4.0," Not because my sound quality is bad, but because the caller on the other end can't hear me clearly"
4099,4.0," Disabling ""HD audio: AAC"" for the bluetooth connection may help"
4100,4.0,"They love them, but my grip is that they always get loose in my ear and either they fall out or they are so loose that others can hear what I am listening to since the airpod isn't 100% seated in my ear"
4101,4.0," Sound quality is good though, and the niece and nephew LOVED them"
4102,4.0, School aged children always want to follow the trends and have name brand things
4103,4.0," I can remember that when I was young so I didn't buy a knockoff pair, I got the real thing and they were happy as hell, and bouncing off the walls when they opened these"
4104,4.0,It was funny because my niece opened her's first and since there were a lot of presents this year my brother who was playing santa hadn't given my nephew his yet
4105,4.0, So when she opened it he was VERY jealous until santa gave him his
4106,4.0, Then he was elated
4107,4.0," Kids are great, and I don't mind giving them named brand items, because just 10-15 years ago I was in their place and knew what it was like to get name brands"
4108,5.0,Absolutely love these
4109,5.0," Like others, I wish I hadn’t waited so long to buy them"
4110,5.0, They’ve improved my quality of life
4111,5.0, I can now watch shows late at night without being worried about the neighbors complaining (I’m also a bit hard of hearing
4112,5.0,) They have allowed me the flexibility to crank up the music while I’m cooking or cleaning
4113,5.0, I can get lots more done and still enjoy the music
4114,5.0, They help me understand the instructions in my yoga class as the sound is more consistent when I’m (or the instructor) are in different positions
4115,5.0, They stay in place and recharge quickly
4116,5.0," Even when I’m recharging my device, I can use the AirPod to listen to a program, ebook, music or whatever before falling sleeping and the next morning everything is good to go"
4117,5.0, Easy to set up with my other devices and that’s really saying something from me 😁
4118,5.0,Love the headset
4119,5.0, I do not care for those that plug into my ear canal so these are so much better and comfortable to me
4120,5.0, The sound it great
4121,5.0,There is an occasional issue with the connection to my phone which means that I have to put them back in the case and take them back out to reset the connection and that seems to work very well
4122,5.0, I have even used them as the microphone to record video
4123,5.0, I love the set an use them so much I have to remember to charge them when not in use
4124,5.0, I believe it takes at least 3 - 5 hours on a call or listening to music or podcasts
4125,5.0,Great product and I truly hope Apple does not stop making them incase I do need to replace them at some time
4126,5.0, I do not like the newer version as I said before
4127,5.0, I really do not like any headsets that plug into my ear canal
4128,5.0,Great product and Highly recommended
4129,4.0,"Coming from an Android ecosystem, I was using the Jabra Elite 75t as my primary headset"
4130,4.0," It worked great - had a great battery life, easy controls (you can mute on the headset itself, which is very helpful for conference calls), and felt very comfortable in my eyes"
4131,4.0,"Fast forward to 2021, and I decided to try out the iPhone 12"
4132,4.0," Unfortunately, the Jabra didn't play too well with the phone, so I decided to get a pair of AirPods to see if it'll be more stable"
4133,4.0, The pairing process was definitely much simpler when everything is within the Apple ecosystem
4134,4.0," The headset felt comfortable, though it's a little looser than the Jabra because it's not a sealing earbud (AirPod pro would be this type)"
4135,4.0," Battery life is not as good, but audio quality is good too"
4136,4.0," All in all, very nice option for those using iPhone"
4137,5.0,"Though these are from the 2nd generation, they are perfection"
4138,5.0, They stay nestled in my ear as no other headphone can do
4139,5.0, I have tried without success all the headphones that are crammed into the ear canal
4140,5.0, Alas none stay in
4141,5.0, But the design of the Apple AirPod stay nestled in my ear
4142,5.0, To say I love them is an understatement
4143,5.0, They have revolutionized my listening experience
4144,5.0," Wonderful sound and ease of use, they are with me wherever I go"
4145,5.0," I would not say they cancel all sound, nor do I desire that outcome"
4146,5.0, The battery life is about five hours of listening time and they charge at lightening speed
4147,5.0,My wife wanted these since the time I bought a pair for myself
4148,5.0, These are amazing as they play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out
4149,5.0, A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward
4150,5.0," To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant"
4151,5.0, Improvement over Gen 1
4152,5.0," Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer helps to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is clear"
4153,5.0, They deliver five hours of listening time and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time
4154,5.0,We love it and can’t really think our daily lives without it
4155,5.0,The only problem that I had sometimes that they slip from my ears
4156,5.0, My wife though never had any such complains
4157,5.0,This an an authentic beautiful pair of AirPods with excellent sound quality
4158,5.0, I’m very active and run about 4x a week
4159,5.0, These stay in my ears during my entire run
4160,5.0, With that said I did have issues with the left headphone not working immediately upon opening and using
4161,5.0, This seems to be a common issue among many users according to the reviews
4162,5.0, I watched every YT tutorial and read several troubleshooting articles
4163,5.0, I reset my AirPods and disconnected them from Bluetooth several times to no avail
4164,5.0," I was just about to ship these back to Amazon, until I finally came across an article that helped solve the issue"
4165,5.0, The audio balance needs to be adjusted
4166,5.0, Follow the steps in the photo I have attached and that should hopefully solve your issue
4167,5.0, I’m leaving this review to hopefully help those who may have future issue with these headphones upon arrival
4168,5.0, Hope this review helps
4169,5.0,"I love Apple's hardware/build quality, but I don't like their software / find their ecosystem restrictive, so I try to avoid them"
4170,5.0,But they've totally nailed it with the Airpods
4171,5.0,Stop overthinking this purchase
4172,5.0,"I've always liked the Apple wired earbuds, and these fit the exact same"
4173,5.0,"A friend had the Pros so I could try them too, but I didn't like the feeling of them being deeper in my ear for long periods of time"
4174,5.0," And oddly enough, noise cancelling makes me feel physically ill (which happens to a small % of people with devices that do active noise cancelling)"
4175,5.0,"I chose these because my priority was microphone quality to sound clear on calls, whether at home or walking + talking"
4176,5.0," I like to walk + talk, but using my Apple wired earbuds made me feel very encumbered and it picked up all sorts of random background/street noise"
4177,5.0,"Based on reviews, I can't seem to find Bluetooth earbuds that score as well on calls as Airpods"
4178,5.0,"Airpods connect quickly + reliably and music sounds solid, too"
4179,5.0,And their charging case just feels convenient/awesome too
4180,5.0,"I think Airpods 2 are the perfect everyday versatile Bluetooth earbuds for anyone, from work calls to personal use (e"
4181,5.0,g
4182,5.0, podcasts/music)
4183,5.0,I wouldn't recommend them for running/working out since I'd be worried about them always falling out of my ears
4184,5.0," In which case, I think there are plenty of ~$40 Bluetooth earbuds that work well for that (and you're less distraught if you lose them / they break)"
4185,5.0,"If you don't mind earbuds deeper in your ears for longer periods of time, Airpods Pro could be great for all uses, including exercise"
4186,5.0,"Unfortunately having an Android phone limits Airpods functionality, but I recommend the AirBattery app so you can easily see their battery levels"
4187,5.0,"If you're in the market for Bluetooth earbuds, and you're not an obsessive audiophile - do yourself a favor and follow the masses by buying some damn Airpods (or Pros)"
4188,5.0, I wasted a *ton* of time researching and trying to find good alternatives outside of Apple
4189,5.0,and they just really don't seem to exist
4190,5.0,"My AirPods were purchased directly from Apple and were shipped by Amazon, so I was expecting and received a genuine product"
4191,5.0," I read a lot of comments regarding if these are the 2nd generation AirPods, and I was a little confused myself"
4192,5.0, The charging case for the AirPods that I received had the indicator light on the inside of the case instead of on the outside; which is how Apple designed the first generation of AirPods
4193,5.0," After doing some research, this is also how Apple designed the second generation of AirPods, IF they do NOT have wireless charging"
4194,5.0," So the only AirPods that do have the indicator on the outside of the case are the second generation, wireless charging AirPods"
4195,5.0," After checking my products warranty on Apple's website, it confirmed that these are the 2nd generation AirPods; and also confirmed that these are real AirPods"
4196,1.0,Absolutely horrible experience with both the product and the shipping
4197,1.0," For starters, I pay for prime membership, and didn’t get the package until around two weeks after I reported that my original package never arrived"
4198,1.0,Now my AirPod case won’t charge my AirPods after less than one year of owning it
4199,1.0," I always took care of the case, bought a protector for it, only ever used compressed air to clean it, and always clipped it into my waist"
4200,1.0, There is absolutely zero reason that it should have stopped working
4201,1.0," Save yourself the time and don’t buy the product, it’s a dud"
4202,1.0, They’re sucking your money out of your wallet and giving horrible quality in return
4203,1.0, Now my AirPods are useless and they’ll charge $70 just for another dud of an AirPods case
4204,5.0,"I didn’t quite understand the hype about these before, but that’s because I never owned any"
4205,5.0, But now I understand
4206,5.0, These earphones are very convenient
4207,5.0," You can hands-free use Siri with them, and ask Siri to do just about anything such as calling and sending texts, and even reading texts to you"
4208,5.0, You can set it up to double tap one of them and an action be performed to control your music
4209,5.0, I will never stop using these for all calls and having one while driving to stay hands free
4210,5.0, These will also be super convenient for work since wired headphones aren’t compatible with my type of work
4211,5.0, 100000/10 recommend these
4212,5.0,So my mom used to take my old Apple headphones all the time cause the fit comfortably for here was always a pain lol so she has been looking for a good pair of ear buds for a long time
4213,5.0," She’s not a tech person at all, so I thought these would be great for her sense she always took my old pair"
4214,5.0,"So for Mother’s Day I got her a pair, oh boy I hit it right on the money"
4215,5.0," She absolutely enjoys them 100%, she tells me every time I see her how great they are"
4216,5.0," She wears one at work, uses them doing outside chores, going for walks, listening to books and so much more"
4217,5.0, The sound quality is better that your old ones and being wireless is so much more productive in life
4218,5.0," Haven’t heard a complaint about them so far, so I recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of earbuds"
4219,5.0,I like that it works flawlessly with my iPhone
4220,5.0, I don't know if it works with any other OS
4221,5.0,I like the sound quality
4222,5.0," If you don't like the balance, you can always EQ your music in the apple settings"
4223,5.0," Bass-boost is pretty good at low volume, but I turn it off when I listen loud"
4224,5.0,I don't like the feel of the ear buds when laying down on them
4225,5.0, I usually use in-ear when laying on my side so compared to that it feels uncomfortable
4226,5.0,"I don't like that you only get 1 option at a time for tap function (pause/play, next song, last song)"
4227,5.0, I found that using the next button is best for the tap function because when you pull a bud out the music pauses
4228,5.0,all and all its a great product and I don't see myself upgrading unless something bad happens
4229,2.0,Overall i have really enjoyed my airpods but have only had them for a couple months
4230,2.0, Sound quality is pretty decent
4231,2.0, Noise cancellation isn’t noticeable but then again these are not designed for noise cancellation so I Wasn’t really expecting that aspect
4232,2.0, I gave noise cancellation 2 stars in case someone might be looking for that
4233,2.0, Battery life is as expected and there isn’t a complaint there
4234,2.0, Here’s my main complaint and I consider it a big one
4235,2.0, For the first couple weeks i have really enjoyed the AirPods and used them for hands free calling
4236,2.0, Within the last week people have started complaining they cannot hear me very well while speaking on the phone
4237,2.0, I have tried adjusting the position of the buds in case the mic wasn’t close to my mouth and I have tried cleaning them but things haven’t improved
4238,2.0, Here’s the kick in the teeth
4239,2.0,yesterday was the last day for me to return them through Amazon
4240,2.0, I’m currently waiting to speak with apple
4241,4.0,"My husband is enjoying the convenience of the ear buds, however, they do not fit snugly into his ears and tend to fall out"
4242,4.0, He is fine using them at his desk but could never use them for exercise - they would not stay in place
4243,4.0," Since purchasing them for my husband, I learned that my son has the same issue with this particular set of buds"
4244,4.0," I'm not sure how you can measure your ear canal prior to purchase, but it is definitely an issue if you want to use these for running or any physical activity, really"
4245,4.0, A nice product if they fit your ear properly
4246,5.0,"If you don't have AirPods yet, you may or may not know just how annoying earbud wires are"
4247,5.0," If you don't have them yet, AirPods seem like a slight improvement from those much less expensive earbuds that came with your phone"
4248,5.0, I came hear to tell you that AirPods are without a doubt the smartest purchase you'll make today
4249,5.0," Maybe, like me, you can't really justify spending $160 on earbuds, since you already have a pair and they're - fine"
4250,5.0, Well
4251,5.0, sometimes the key to success is learning to ignore your own ignorance
4252,5.0," There are things you shouldn't bother spending money on (cable tv, birthday cards, men's underwear that isn't Merino wool, meat at Wal-mart, etc"
4253,5.0,) AirPods are not on that list
4254,5.0,So stop questioning it
4255,5.0, Buy these magic ear spoons
4256,5.0, You'll bounce back financially in no time and forget you ever spent the money
4257,5.0," Sure, AirPodsare a little expensive, but consider the cost of not owning them"
4258,5.0,And no they won't fall out of your ears - unless you're driving on a back road in Maine in late February
4259,5.0,Bought these for my daughter for her birthday
4260,5.0, She is in love with them
4261,5.0," Of course who hasn’t been, but that’s standard, right"
4262,5.0," They work flawlessly, and seem to be doing everything the way they were supposed to"
4263,5.0," She has worn them everyday, and they have been holding up great"
4264,5.0," I would suggest that you keep the box that they come in as you would any Apple product, so that you have the serial number of them, just in case they are stolen"
4265,5.0," It has happened at her school, and the box is what saved the one child from having them gone forever"
4266,5.0," Luckily, I do not allow my daughter to take them to school, although I cannot watch her every move, so I trust she isn’t"
4267,5.0,I bought this because of a holiday sale
4268,5.0," More than I would usually spend on earbuds, but I had recently upgraded my iPhone and my new model only has the lightning adapter for headphone connections"
4269,5.0," While I did but adapters for it, the brand I bought didn't seem to work (there were three in the package and I haven't tested the others yet)"
4270,5.0," When I saw this on sale, I went ahead and purchased it"
4271,5.0, It is a joy to use and sounds great
4272,5.0," Once linked yo your phone, the Airpods link to the phone the minute you open the charging case and pull out the buds-- automatically"
4273,5.0," And while I prefer a rubberized tip, the molded plastic does not fall out of my ear"
4274,5.0, So I'm very happy with the purchase
4275,4.0,"Big annoyance with these is they sometimes charge inconsistently where only one airpod will charge, i found inserting a slim piece of paper in the top of the case will tighten up the case enough that it charges consistently, but its a pain to have to do this"
4276,4.0," Overall, having to use the charging case which also prevents you from permanently using ear hooks without removing/placing them on each time is also poor"
4277,4.0, Why they can't come up with a more convenient charging case is beyond me
4278,4.0," Also would be great if they had an on-off button, but if they're out of the case they are on"
4279,4.0, This causes some minor inconvenience as well
4280,4.0," These little things are so trivial to fix, but Apple won't fix them, so I went with four stars"
4281,2.0,I have had nothing but issues with these
4282,2.0,"Apple tried to make these so smart, but they never work as intended"
4283,2.0," Use them for meetings but when you touch or adjust them in your ears, they disconnect you from the call"
4284,2.0, I have double tap actions turned off
4285,2.0,I go on runs with them and enjoy the sound and the comfort
4286,2.0," Other than that, the software and function of them are awful"
4287,2.0, Don't join an important meeting with these unless you plan on sitting absolutely still and not touching them
4288,2.0,I can't believe how bad these were engineered
4289,1.0,I had my first pair of Air Pods (bought directly from an Apple store) for almost 3 years
4290,1.0, They were amazing
4291,1.0, This pair lasted a few months and I got inconsistent pairing and sound quality
4292,1.0," I highly recommend against buying Apple products from Amazon but if you do buy something, make you sure register it with Apple to make sure it’s legit and wasn’t registered before then returned"
4293,1.0,Broken and cannot return
4294,1.0, Just stopped working and now Im stuck with zip for $120
4295,1.0," Looks like these all fail, so many refurbished and returned items, especially right side like mine"
4296,1.0,I have owned these AirPods for less than 2 months and they are already not working
4297,1.0, I’ve only used them a handful of times when studying for major exams and cleaning around my house
4298,1.0, I have tried everything and even researched how to fix my issue
4299,1.0, They are glitching and only connecting for 5-6 seconds before crackling and not working at all
4300,1.0, I even have a screen recording off my iPhone of the AirPods glitching when connected
4301,1.0, I contacted amazon “support” and he told me he could not help me even though I’m only 10 days past the return window and would not give me an exchange
4302,1.0, What a waste
4303,1.0, I would not order these through amazon
4304,1.0, Buy directly from Apple
4305,3.0,Disclaimer: I didn't want to get these
4306,3.0, I would prefer to use wired earbuds
4307,3.0," But with the removal of the 3mm headphone jack in all iPhones, I can no longer simultaneously charge the phone and use the earbuds which is a huge problem"
4308,3.0,"So I tried these, which work pretty well most of the time"
4309,3.0," Audio quality is just ok - I am frequently having people on the line say ""what"
4310,3.0,""" because they can't hear me any time there is ambient background noise"
4311,3.0," A bigger annoyance is about 10% of the time when I answer the phone, the airpods just don't work - they don't pick up the call, but block the call from working on speaker or phone either, so both parties sit there saying ""hello"
4312,3.0,""" ""hello"
4313,3.0,""" ""hello"
4314,3.0,""" until somebody hangs up and tries again"
4315,3.0,"I'd rather just have my headphone jack back,"
4316,2.0,I was really hopeful and excited about using Air Pods for my online meetings instead of corded ear buds
4317,2.0, I have no complaints about the sound or microphone
4318,2.0, Both were excellent
4319,2.0," The fit was a little so-so because they’re meant to be one-size-fits-all and there are no size options, so they ended up being a little big for my ears"
4320,2.0," The biggest fail, however, is the battery life"
4321,2.0," I could get through a single meeting that lasted no more than 45 minutes and then they would die, had to be placed back in the charging case"
4322,2.0, Even the charging case didn’t hold a charge for long
4323,2.0, Really disappointed about that so I had to return them
4324,1.0,It’s on me for not returning this in the allotted time
4325,1.0, But my wife bought these and she was never able to get them connected from day 1
4326,1.0," Upset, she threw them in a drawer hoping to have me get to it later"
4327,1.0, We found them recently and I tried everything to connect them
4328,1.0, Say with Apple support for over an hour
4329,1.0, While they were very helpful the conclusion was that it is a hardware issue as if someone may have connected them before our ownership and broken them before the sale to me
4330,1.0," Anyway, again we take the hit for letting time slip by, but to buy a high priced product that never works from the beginning really sucks"
4331,5.0,I’ve been in the market for new Bluetooth headphones for awhile while workingout
4332,5.0," The ones I used were large, fell off easy, and would get in the way while lifting weights"
4333,5.0,"I need something that wouldn’t destroy the bank, had a long battery life, and would stay in my ears while laying on a bench or pressing weights above my head"
4334,5.0,"They connected to my phone with no issue after opening, the charger and booklet looked good as new"
4335,5.0,"I highly suggest this to anybody looking for new headphones while at the gym, my only suggestion is to clean them after use if you sweat a lot to ensure they stay in good condition (though it isn’t necessary)"
4336,5.0,"You’ll need to charge fairly often though, after a new hour session, I find that the charging box will be about 50-60% battery"
4337,5.0,Hope this helps someone
4338,5.0,Shocked that these fit as the free plug ins that apple provides never fit me
4339,5.0, My ears are on the small side; I usually use the smallest plugs
4340,5.0, These are not what I’d call secure but good enough
4341,5.0, If I am going in walks (or working out) I suggest getting those clips that fit on the ends do that you don’t lose these as it does not take much movement to fall out
4342,5.0, For seating or lying it is not a big issue
4343,5.0, Seamless Bluetooth connection to the phone and can work easily with multiple devices
4344,5.0, When switching just go to settings/bluetooth and hit connect if switching devices from the one last used
4345,5.0," Could greatly improve the battery life, that being said they recharge quickly but this doesn’t help when in the go"
4346,3.0,"Apple AirPods work well within the Apple ecosystem, but if you try to take them between other devices (windows computers, Android phones, etc"
4347,3.0,) then be prepared for flaky Bluetooth connectivity
4348,3.0," Battery life isn't impressive, but that's to be expected with the smaller size"
4349,3.0,"For my daily-driver phone/podcast/workout headset, I purchased an Aeropex Aftershokz bone conducting headset and for higher-quality audio needs or music, I use my Bose QuietComfort 35 headset"
4350,1.0,"After about 6 months of very light use, the microphones became so unreliable that I can no longer use these for phone calls"
4351,1.0, Apparently this is a common defect from what I’ve read online
4352,1.0, I have tried every fix suggested online to no avail
4353,1.0," Shame on you, Apple"
4354,1.0, I could have bought better sounding and more reliable earbuds for half the price
4355,3.0,"I got these AirPods for my iPhone and they work seamlessly together, their great for phone calls where u just tap them to answer and hangs up phone calls"
4356,3.0, And u can activate Siri even if your phone can’t hear u using the headphones
4357,3.0," The sound quality is good, but they r not noise canceling at all so if your in a busy area ur ganna have to crank up that volume"
4358,3.0," One of the things I don’t like about them is it’s supposed to connect instantly when u put them in your ears the issue is over time there started to be a longer and longer lag from when I put them in my ears till they connect and I sometimes have to go into settings and manually connect them, I have a different pair of headphones not from Apple which doesn’t have this issue so I’m a bit disappointed about that"
4359,3.0, But overall their great if u have a Apple product to connect to
4360,5.0,We initially tried a pair of AirPod-like earbuds and they were pretty good
4361,5.0, It was just difficult paying $200+ for earbuds when there were so many good alternatives on the market
4362,5.0," When the price dropped, we decided to give the real deal a try and boy are we happy with our decision"
4363,5.0," All of the Apple convenience (easy pairing to all devices, sound, great fit, small footprint) shine through and make these a wonderful set of earbuds"
4364,3.0,These work well enough but the whole reason I bought them was not wanting to shove my phone in my waist and to walk ten steps away while listening and the range on them really stinks
4365,3.0, I have plenty of blue tooth devices and I’m aware they aren’t meant to range a million miles away or anything but wandering into the next room & having them go out is really annoying
4366,3.0, Also they won’t connect with my Apple Watch another reason for purchase to cut the phone out of the equation with audibles download to watch with wireless headphones feature
4367,3.0, I feel like they’re really glitchy too - randomly refusing to play when tapped and skipping forward when I try to tap to play
4368,3.0, Finally the mic is iffy - I’ve had way too many people going “what what what I can’t head you” while talking with them who hear totally fine if I switch to my cars Bluetooth or my cell speaker
4369,3.0, When they work they work and the charging case is neat but lots of issues in my opinion too
4370,5.0,Most convenient purchase of my life
4371,5.0, Easy to walk around the city and have my podcast in my ears on my way to work
4372,5.0, Some of which are poor quality so it's nice to have high quality buds so I don't miss a single second of the true crime stories
4373,5.0, They stay in my ear so well
4374,5.0, And sometimes I forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable and light
4375,5.0," And the charging case is genius, you put you buds securely away and they charge without you having to think about it"
4376,5.0, I charge the case every couple days and can listen to fully charged bugs for a solid 1/4 of a day before I need to charge again
4377,5.0," And with my hair down, my coworkers have no idea I am tuning them out with cold cases and serial killers"
4378,5.0,"It's an Apple product, and like all Apple products its very beautifully and nicely packaged, and for the most part works very good"
4379,5.0," And, like all Apple products they are manufactured by China for pennies on the dollar, and then Apple marks up the price by a thousand percent, and passes that very expensive price to US customers"
4380,5.0," Nothing more needs to be said about Apple products and business practices in the US, and support for foreign labor, instead of US labor"
4381,5.0," And, don't forget the Apple Care they would love for you to get, that strangely always seems to expire just a few days before your product gives out"
4382,5.0," It's like if they install a Mission Imposible ""this item will self destruct in 5 sec"" destruct switch inside your item to go off a few days before your Apple care expires"
4383,1.0,"Within a few months of getting them, they started disconnecting while listening to music"
4384,1.0," It never happened when on a phone call, so I could live with that"
4385,1.0," However, at about 6 months, when on a call, people started saying the couldn't hear me"
4386,1.0," It got worse and worse,"
4387,1.0," Now 8 months in, they are basically unusable for phone calls"
4388,1.0," I contacted Apple, and they said that they are not covered under warranty even though they are less than a year old"
4389,1.0, I will never buy another apple product
4390,2.0,These aren’t the most comfortable because I feel like I really have to jam these in my ears & twist them so They stay in place
4391,2.0," If doing any moderately rigorous jog or higher, these continually need to be readjusted"
4392,2.0, I do love that the case charges & the battery life on both the case & the buds is good
4393,2.0, They are noise canceling enough for my needs & were so so user friendly to set up
4394,2.0,"Update—3 months in, the sound sucks"
4395,2.0,"it’s very low & ive followed various bits of input to clean, turn off/on Bluetooth etc & nothing worked"
4396,2.0," After less than 3 mo, that’s not acceptable"
4397,5.0,I love my AirPods
4398,5.0, I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature
4399,5.0, Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more
4400,5.0,Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice
4401,5.0,I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had
4402,5.0, I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right
4403,5.0, I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again
4404,5.0, I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up
4405,5.0,I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time
4406,5.0,First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality
4407,5.0,But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case
4408,5.0, The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used
4409,5.0, If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing
4410,5.0, The talk time on them is very long as well
4411,5.0, I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says
4412,5.0,I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses
4413,5.0, I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone
4414,5.0,I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad
4415,5.0,I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone
4416,5.0, Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc
4417,5.0, and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great
4418,5.0,So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone
4419,4.0,Overall very pleased with these AirPods
4420,4.0," Thought they were a little expensive, but finally bit the bullet and bought them"
4421,4.0, No regrets
4422,4.0, Especially useful when connecting to devices via Bluetooth and not having to be tethered with a cord
4423,4.0, Only slight issue is occasionally the left earbud will cut out but all I have to do is take it out of my ear and then put it back in and the sound usually comes right back on
4424,4.0, Sometimes I will put it back in the case for a minute and then it will work again as well
4425,4.0, But this is just a minor glitch and I would still buy them again
4426,1.0,"I received the headphones and of course, I immediately tried to connect them to my phone"
4427,1.0," However, it wouldn’t connect"
4428,1.0, The light showed up green when I opened the lid and the light turned white when I held onto the button but no flashing light or anything
4429,1.0, It wouldn’t even show up as an unconnected device on my phone
4430,1.0, I asked my sister for help who also owns AirPods and she noticed that the AirPods were made in Vietnam and hers were made in China
4431,1.0, I don’t know if this had anything to do with it and if this was an indicator that I was ripped off but either way these iPods were not functioning correctly
4432,1.0,"On top of that when I called the number provided for assistance the person talking to me gave me a lot of attitude and kept saying ""just connect it"
4433,1.0,""" When clearly that's what I'm calling for"
4434,5.0,"Life in this coastal area became incredibly noisy this year of CV19, lots of new residents, lots of noise and discourteous behavior"
4435,5.0," Hard to take the daily onslaught of noise from these fools, until purchasing these AirPods"
4436,5.0," Ideally, people would be respectful of one another, but we know that to be a largely bygone trait"
4437,5.0," Now, instead of taking a drive or retreating indoors to get away from the racket, I just use the AirPods to both cancel and drown out the nonsense"
4438,5.0, Wish I'd thought of it sooner
4439,5.0,"Well, I think I love these for the reason everyone else does"
4440,5.0," No annoying wires, discreet if you have long hair 😊 sound is great and works seamlessly with your iPhone"
4441,5.0," I find myself listening to music far more than I did before and telephone conversations, on the go, are a breeze as well"
4442,5.0, I did have problem getting them delivered but I won’t go into it because Amazon made it right fairly quick
4443,5.0," And just to let you know because I read all the questions and answers before purchasing, no Amazon is not lying to you these are the latest model AirPods ( gen 2 ) but without the wireless charging case"
4444,5.0, The case still holds extra charge but you will have to plug it in to charge
4445,5.0," You can tell you have received the 2nd gen by turning on messages with Siri, only with 2 gen and some Beats headphones Siri can read you your text messages as they come in"
4446,5.0, Cheers
4447,5.0,"I didn't originally want to spend the extra money for airpods, and had some other brand wireless bluetooth headphones"
4448,5.0," Those worked fine (until they stopped charging for no reason), but the airpods really do work so much better, especially if you have an iphone"
4449,5.0," Connecting them to the iphone takes seconds, you just hold the case next to your phone and open it"
4450,5.0, The sound quality is great
4451,5.0," The automatic pausing when you take out one airpod is a great feature, and they have a pretty long range - I can leave my phone downstairs and still be connected"
4452,5.0, The battery life isn't the longest but they charge super quick so it's not a big deal
4453,5.0," They're also really comfortable, I have weirdly small ears and I can wear these for hours without any pain or irritation"
4454,5.0,"Ok soooo I had some previous air pods that were a gift from two years ago and they were OK, but I decided to get a new pair of AirPods"
4455,5.0, Reading the reviews I was SUPER skeptical because I didn’t want to spend my money and get a horrible pair of AirPods only to have to return them
4456,5.0, These AirPods are AMAZINGGGGG
4457,5.0, The sound quality on these AirPods are WAYY better than the AirPods that I have had for two years
4458,5.0, The base in these AirPods are better (pshhh who am I kidding my other AirPods didn’t have base like these do HONESTLY 🥴) the sound quality is better
4459,5.0, They look exactly the same as my previous pair of AirPods but sound wise it’s a huge upgrade and I’m so happy with my purchase
4460,3.0,Overrated IMO
4461,3.0," Sound quality is great, and obviously the novelty of how low profile they are is the best feature"
4462,3.0," However, the pairing technology/functionality is atrocious"
4463,3.0, Forget about using them on a Windows computer with bluetooth
4464,3.0, Jumbles and crosses wires with everything in the system
4465,3.0," Readjusts your mic settings, turns your volume up and down"
4466,3.0, Total mess
4467,3.0,And the worst part:
4468,3.0,Randomly turns your volume to literal max on your phone when they automatically reconnect
4469,3.0, Can really f*** the rest of your day up and piss you off (at least for me)
4470,5.0,Someone told me that buying airpods was like buying an ipod
4471,5.0,"once you had that ipod, there was no going back to a CD player"
4472,5.0, It's the same thing
4473,5.0,"once you have the airpods, there's no going back to headphones with a cord"
4474,5.0,"If you are delaying, just BUY THEM"
4475,5.0," Of all the new tech items I have bought (apple watch, google home, etc"
4476,5.0,"), this is the one that I can say with absolute certainty that is essential"
4477,5.0,"It's a godsend when I'm walking my dog, talking to people while doing other things like folding laundry, or just being able to listen to my podcasts/music while doing chores"
4478,5.0,Do it
4479,2.0,"When I read the other reviews, I see a lot of credence given to the “gee whiz” factor of the new chip, double tap, “Hey Siri”, etc"
4480,2.0," But let’s be honest, what is important"
4481,2.0," Sound quality, microphone quality, noise cancellation, and ease of use (pairing, connecting, etc"
4482,2.0,)
4483,2.0,"Sound quality, I give them a VERY generous 2 out of 5"
4484,2.0," There is NO bass, little treble, so I’m left with a tinny sound with no warmth"
4485,2.0," It’s terrible, and I’ve had better sound from $10 ear buds"
4486,2.0," On the other hand, on phone calls and Skype calls via PC, the sound is loud and clear, just staccato"
4487,2.0,"Microphone quality/noise cancellation: Leaving messages for myself, if there is any noise cancellation I can’t hear it"
4488,2.0, I hear ALL the background noise just as well as I hear myself
4489,2.0," Other people seem to hear me loudly, but not necessarily clearly"
4490,2.0,"Oh gee, I can pair by holding the open case close to my device"
4491,2.0, Big whoop
4492,2.0," If my PC is currently using my desktop speakers, I have to go to the Bluetooth controls and connect the already paired AirPods"
4493,2.0, That’s ridiculous
4494,2.0, All my other Bluetooth headsets are automatically included in the audio output selections once they are paired
4495,2.0, Why should I have to go to Bluetooth settings to “connect” AirPods when they’ve already paired
4496,2.0, This is TERRIBLE
4497,2.0,"All in all, had I known what I was getting, i would have purchased something else"
4498,2.0," As it is, I don’t want to put another $150 to $300 into another set of Bluetooth buds"
4499,2.0," But I’m listening to music as I write this, and it’s terrible"
4500,2.0," Maybe others like the sound, but when a bass guitar hitting a low C or low G comes out sounding like a drum, it’s not good"
4501,3.0,"Pros: Voice activated with Siri (awesome feature); secure compact charging case; Very good bass; Very good sound quality; Battery life seems good, they were at about 70% when I received them"
4502,3.0,Cons: Volume is not noteworthy (though the sound quality is very good); though it's on par with other quality ear buds that i've tried
4503,3.0, I can hear outside noise;
4504,3.0,"Although you can play and skip songs via touching the ear buds while they're in your ears, you can't adjust the volume by sliding your finger along the earbuds, which is a feature that I can do with my current tic pods"
4505,3.0,Conclusion: These are not worth $150
4506,3.0, My current Tic-Pods that I paid [overpaid] $129 for are equal quality and equal volume
4507,3.0," In fairness, i'm not pleased with the volume level of my current Tic Pods, but I was hoping that these AirPods would surpass them in volume level, but they did not"
4508,4.0,I finally convinced myself to buy a pair of AirPods
4509,4.0," First off after buying these I wish I would have went ahead and bought the AirPod Pro for the active noise cancellation and sweat and water resistance, but other than that I am very satisfied with these headphones"
4510,4.0," I’ve had $30-$40 pairs of true wireless headphones and honestly these don’t sound much better, but other pairs I have purchased always had issues with connecting and dropping out and also never lasted more than 6 months for me"
4511,4.0," With AirPods, connecting is so seamless and simple and the quality and feel of the headphones are so great, it’s just another level of experience with these headphones"
4512,4.0, I’m very satisfied with my AirPods
4513,4.0, I gave 4 stars for the sound quality because for me the price for the sound quality was just too high when I compare them to my $30 true wireless headphones from Soundpeats which sound great for me
4514,4.0," I usually only wear headphones at the gym (but I might start wearing them more now) so again I wish I would’ve gone ahead and went for the AirPod Pro for another $100 for the active noise cancellation and sweat resistance, but for now I’m satisfied with these AirPods"
4515,4.0," I haven’t owned these for long, so I’ll see how long they last me and how they do over time"
4516,5.0,"Definitely genuine Apple product, and they came in sealed Apple packaging"
4517,5.0, But I was dismayed that they came already named
4518,5.0,I was further upset that they were named:”stupid’s AirPods”
4519,5.0,"Ok, yeah, perhaps I am in fact stupid"
4520,5.0," but still, how did they know that"
4521,5.0,🤣
4522,5.0,"Anyhow, they work well"
4523,5.0,"Although, this will likely be the last time I buy an Apple product from amazon"
4524,5.0,As soon as I opened these I knew I had made a mistake and returned them for the AirPods Pro for the following reasons - if you have small ears these will not fit as well as the Pro because of the way they sit in your ears and secondly if you have any type of hearing impairment the Pros are better because they fit deeper into the ear canal which delivers much better sound quality (my husband has the Pro so I was able to try his)
4525,5.0, Like all Apple’s products these are of the highest quality as is Amazon’s customer service
4526,5.0,"Well, I was late on the purchase of these because I didn't want yet another piece of electronics to keep up with and charge"
4527,5.0," Yet, now I am here to tell you that these are an amazing, and well pretty much life changing"
4528,5.0," No more having to untangle the headset cords, or only being able to charge your iPhone while listening to a podcast or music; or slamming them in the car door (yes, I managed to do this while on the Vineyard for vacation) and all but destroying them"
4529,5.0, The charge lasts pretty much a full day
4530,4.0,I love these earbuds and never leave home without them
4531,4.0, The wireless connectivity is great and the range is much larger than I initially thought
4532,4.0, 4 stars for battery because I can tell that the battery is getting worse now that I have had them for a few months
4533,4.0, I am very hard on my headphones but they still do hold up and there is no cord to get tangled
4534,4.0," The sound quality is great as well as noise cancellation, though they do not hold up when compared to my Bose on ear wireless headphones, which is to be expected"
4535,4.0, I have struggled to get the controls to work (like tapping to pause) but I suspect that is user error
4536,4.0," The mic is decent, though it could be better"
4537,4.0, It is super helpful to have these headphones connected to my Apple Watch and iPhone
4538,4.0, I highly recommend them for daily use
4539,5.0,Can't say I have ever bought a more perfect item
4540,5.0, The case is small and white so easy to find in my crowded purse or on my crowded desk
4541,5.0," The phones pair easily, are quick to put on and the sound is awesome"
4542,5.0, No cables dangling around makes them perfect
4543,5.0," I watch movies on airplanes, using my ipad or cell phone without bothering my seat mates"
4544,5.0,Not quite 3 months later they stopped worklng
4545,5.0, i went to the great Apple Support site and learned how to reset them
4546,5.0, That lasted an hour and now they are dead again
4547,5.0, I'll be back here IF I can get them permanently fixed
4548,5.0, i miss them soooo much
4549,5.0,This is my second pair of airpods
4550,5.0, I absolutely love these things
4551,5.0, I think these ones are better than the pros if you want to be able to wear them but still have a concept of what is going on around you
4552,5.0," I use these all the time for phone calls, and people say that I am heard perfectly"
4553,5.0, It makes hand free talking extremely easy
4554,5.0," I wear them for school work, and for music as well"
4555,5.0, I am extremely
4556,5.0,pleased with the sound quality on these little guys as well
4557,5.0," If you are looking for someone completely noise cancelling, get the pros"
4558,5.0, But I think these hold a lot of value in not being as noise cancelling because you can wear them in public and still know what is going on around you for safety
4559,4.0,These Apple AirPods sound great on all devises
4560,4.0, They sound good on phone calls also
4561,4.0," I'm returning because I received the 2nd Generation (Newest Upgrade) AirPods, but the case was 1st Generation"
4562,4.0, The 1st generation has the charging light on the inside cover
4563,4.0, The 2nd generation case has a charging light on the outside of the case
4564,4.0," The 2nd generation, which is the Newest Upgrade version also has a different/better chip in the case"
4565,4.0, It's suppose to charge better and longer
4566,4.0, Amazon told me to contact Apple
4567,4.0," I was told by Apple that Amazon isn't an Authorized seller of Apple products, (including Apple AirPods)"
4568,4.0, Apple informed me to return the AirPods to Amazon
4569,4.0," I was extremely happy with the sound, fit and quality of these AirPods"
4570,4.0, The package arrived the same day I ordered them
4571,4.0," The package was in excellent, sealed condition"
4572,5.0,"Now when I talk to myself people can see that I have these things in my ear and think oh he’s talking to someone on the phone… yeah sure, that’s what I’m doing……"
4573,5.0, ;)
4574,1.0,"Before buying, I called to confirm these were new and from Apple, and Amazon said yes"
4575,1.0,"After deliver and setup, Apple said they were purchased two months ago, based on the serial number"
4576,1.0, This would reduce my warranty period
4577,1.0,"Now I call Amazon, and they claim they're still new, but say I bought from them instead of Amazon two months ago"
4578,1.0, I feel cheated
4579,1.0, Is the warranty still any good
4580,1.0," Are they actually new, or was that a lie too"
4581,5.0,These were purchased for my grandson
4582,5.0, He likes them very much and I purchased the case for him to store them in for protection and safety
4583,5.0, He can clip them to his pant loop and go and know they are protected and safe
4584,5.0,My only concern is the music he chooses
4585,5.0, I pray he is listening to music that will edify and not influence him for wrong
4586,5.0, Music is powerful and has a great influence over all of us
4587,5.0," So much out there today I wouldn't want anyone to expose themselves to, but being a grand mother, it is not my responsibility to govern his ears and heart, but I pray for him"
4588,5.0," Yes, I bought the AirPods"
4589,5.0, He is going to listen regardless of how he listens
4590,5.0, Just hoping his heart is right and he will listen to music that edifies his spirit
4591,5.0," We should always remember Shadrack, Mechach and Abednigo"
4592,5.0, When they heard the music they were to bow to the image
4593,5.0, Just sayin
4594,5.0, The AirPods are nice
4595,5.0, I would recommend them
4596,5.0,I ordered the Apple AirPods during the Black Friday sale
4597,5.0, Got a great price
4598,5.0, Got the package the following Wednesday
4599,5.0, They arrived wrapped in the factory plastic
4600,5.0, I opened the box and everything was there
4601,5.0, It came with the chargeable case with a pair of AirPods
4602,5.0," Also a Lightning to USB cable for charging, as well as all of the printed materials"
4603,5.0,They paired very easily with my iPhone XR
4604,5.0, They are super easy to use and the sound is superb
4605,5.0, I highly recommend these if you want a great pair of ear buds
4606,5.0," Obviously, they aren’t gonna work well while cutting the grass due to the noise"
4607,5.0," However, if you want a quality set of ear buds, these are the ones"
4608,5.0,"I want to add, these are the latest (2nd Generation) Apple AirPods"
4609,5.0, I did check on the AirPods themselves and the model is A2032
4610,5.0, I just wanted to add that last little bit in case someone questions whether these indeed are the latest model available
4611,4.0,"I have tried 4 different types of wireless earbuds, and the Apple Air-Pods work the best with Apple products with seamless paring and moving back and forth between Apple devices"
4612,4.0, They are uncomfortable but the sound is good
4613,4.0, The main thing I don't like is that I do not get 4 hours in one use
4614,4.0, That is the only reason that I liked some of the other earbuds
4615,4.0,long battery life
4616,4.0," My son has the gen 1 for at least two years, and there have been no problems with them"
4617,4.0, Other brands give out and start having problems after a few months
4618,4.0,if not sooner
4619,4.0," There are things that I don't like about the air-pods, but overall, they are the best air-pods for your Apple products"
4620,5.0,i am new to aipods but i think they are great
4621,5.0," the sound is so good, sometimes when its a recorded voice, i think someone in the room is talking to me"
4622,5.0, i have a bit of a problem keeping the left one in so i bought a lanyard so that i don't lose it
4623,5.0, whomever I'm talking to has no problem hearing me as opposed to my iPhone 12 without the airpods
4624,5.0, i don't know what the standard range is but was also surprised how far i can be away from my phone so that i can get other things done while I'm on the phone
4625,5.0,highly recommend
4626,5.0,There is only life before airpods and after and I don't ever want to go back to life without them
4627,5.0,I recommend these to anyone who is a heavy apple user with multiple devices as these are made to sync with your iCloud account easily across multiple devices
4628,5.0," Add exceptional apple sound quality, sleek, sexy look and the features you get from the smart chip there is no competition"
4629,5.0,I got the silicone tips for mine and It has transformed these already amazing headphones to near perfect
4630,5.0, It makes the bass louder and cancels out the background sounds
4631,5.0,RIP to all my other headphones
4632,1.0,"I’ve had to reset the AirPods a few times now, and finally after 2 months the microphone has completely stopped"
4633,1.0,Don’t waste your money like I did
4634,1.0, I should have bought beats or anything else
4635,1.0, Ugh I feel sick wasting money on these
4636,1.0," dealing with Apple is a nightmare, and I live where there nearest apple center is 10 hours away"
4637,1.0,Sound quality isn’t as good as other wireless headphones I’ve had that were $40 I’m disappointed in apple
4638,1.0, Not to mention after an hour of use these hurt
4639,1.0, Not made for small ears
4640,5.0,I really-really like them
4641,5.0," I was dropping my iPhone pretty regularly (and, therefore, had to send it to Apple for an out-of-warranty battery replacement couple of times) because headphone wires kept getting somewhere (cabinet knobs and handles most of the times)"
4642,5.0, So my wife decided to get me wireless ones
4643,5.0, And these ones rock
4644,5.0,* Sound quality has definitely improved
4645,5.0," I'm sure Apple has a smart explanation for that but all I can say is yes, I hear that the sound is better in these headphones than in regular (wired) ones"
4646,5.0,* Noise cancellation definitely works - I have to remove one of the headphones to hear someone
4647,5.0,"* Cool feature: when you remove one of the headphones from your ear, the video/music you're currently watching/listening to is paused"
4648,5.0, Can you believe this
4649,5.0, But wait
4650,5.0, There is more
4651,5.0," When you put that headphone back in, that video/music is resumed"
4652,5.0, magic
4653,5.0,* Battery life is good/excellent (I'd rate it 4
4654,5.0,5 out of 5)
4655,5.0, It is definitely not outstanding/fantastic/mind-blowing but it is pretty darn good for the size
4656,5.0,I can't thank my wife enough for this present
4657,3.0,"As most Apple products are, these work pretty well"
4658,3.0," I know this isn't the case for everyone, but these fit in my ears perfectly and comfortably"
4659,3.0, I can wear them for hours at a time without noticing them
4660,3.0, I've been using these with an Android phone with some interesting results
4661,3.0,Things I love about them:
4662,3.0,- How quickly they connect
4663,3.0, These things connect almost immediately once you open the lid for the case
4664,3.0,"- You can use either one on their own if you want, it doesn't matter which"
4665,3.0,- The call quality is fantastic
4666,3.0, I love taking calls on these things
4667,3.0,- The range is pretty great
4668,3.0, I can set my phone down and walk around nearby rooms most of the time without any issue
4669,3.0,Things I don't love:
4670,3.0,- The audio quality is alright
4671,3.0, It's about the same as the wired EarPods
4672,3.0," Not bad, but nothing amazing"
4673,3.0,- It's too easy to hear what's going on around me
4674,3.0, They have no noise cancellation whatsoever
4675,3.0, I could literally carry on full conversations with people while listening to these if I wanted
4676,3.0,- Connectivity issues
4677,3.0," The range is usually good, but sometimes the connectivity is awful"
4678,3.0," I can walk around with my phone in my pocket and put my hand over my phone, and these will skip in and out"
4679,3.0, Sometimes they'll even get out of sync a little bit
4680,3.0, This has happened extensively
4681,3.0," I made a warranty claim on them and Apple said they couldn't find any problems so they sent them back, and I still have those issues"
4682,3.0," I also wonder how much this has to do with my phone though, because my phone (Samsung Galaxy S9) Bluetooth doesn't seem the strongest sometimes"
4683,3.0,"If you have an iPhone, I'd recommend giving them a go"
4684,3.0, But I think there are definitely better deals out there
4685,5.0,I tried a some earbuds that were highly rated by CNET and they sounded so tinny that I had to return them
4686,5.0, Bought the Apple AirPods and all was well
4687,5.0," I use the earbuds mostly to get the news from NPR, so I was interested in talk clarity"
4688,5.0, The Apple AirPods fit the bill
4689,5.0," I have tried ear phones that had built in noise canceling and found that the noise cancellation affected the quality of the audio, so the fact the AirPods did not have noise cancellation was a plus for me"
4690,5.0," Something to consider, after a lot of hard use and occasional drops to the cement, my last set of Apple AirPods gave out after 3-4 years"
4691,5.0," Hopefully, the new ones will last longer"
4692,5.0,I bought these for my GF for Christmas and she is in love
4693,5.0," Before this, she hadn't had any wireless bluetooth earbuds before, so this review is coming from a ""non audiophile"" and first time user for headphones like this"
4694,5.0, it paired to her iPhone instantly and she says the fit is very comfortable
4695,5.0, She often wears them for hours listening to audio books
4696,5.0," There ins't much in the noise cancelation catagorey, but that's expected with ""buds"""
4697,5.0, The fact that you can pause the music with gestures and also by taking one ear bud out blew us away
4698,5.0, Would recommend this product or any Apple user looking for a great pair of buds
4699,1.0,Very good quality
4700,1.0, I didn't think i wanted these silly things at all but boy
4701,1.0, Do they come in handy and sound pretty darn good in my opinion
4702,1.0,I would absolutely buy these if you are even questioning it in any way
4703,1.0,The reason i gave one star is because it said it was the latest model when in fact these are the first edition ones
4704,1.0, I personally like these fine and don't care about the wireless charging but if that is important to you this is fooling you
4705,1.0, They are NOT the latest model
4706,1.0,Personally i think this is a better deal
4707,1.0, I just don't like to be fooled by a seller
4708,3.0,These worked great and fit well until 18 months after purchase the first few seconds of speaking would not be heard by anyone while using the airpods
4709,3.0, Upon a search for the problem was the right microphone that failed
4710,3.0," Settings allow airpods to automatically pick one of the pods to transmit, or dedicate left or right"
4711,3.0, Switching between the two showed the right had failed
4712,3.0," The system allows to dedicate one side use of the microphone, so changing to the left has temporarily fixed the issue"
4713,3.0, But the Jabra headphones i also have are 2x as old and no issues like this
4714,3.0, Speakers and sound are working great
4715,3.0, Connectivity has no issues
4716,3.0, Fit is good
4717,5.0,I’d like to mention some things to clear up confusion for some
4718,5.0,The pods are AirPods 2 models with models A2032/2031 imprinted on the underside of each pod respectfully
4719,5.0," Also when saying “Hey Siri,” the pods will wait for next response vs"
4720,5.0, the AirPods 1 where you’d have to set a double tap action to activate it
4721,5.0,The charging case on the other hand is the regular lightning charging case without wireless charging as there is no light in the front to indicate wireless charging
4722,5.0, This is indicated on the product details as it should and is correct
4723,5.0, I personally do not thing the wireless charger is worth it unless you already have a wireless charging pad laying around so the regular will do
4724,5.0,"Overall, sound quality is great and clear"
4725,5.0,Battery lasts fairly long and are worth getting if you can get them for a cheaper price
4726,5.0,I got these for my girlfriend and she loves them
4727,5.0, You will definitely see me in the AirPods Pro once my original AirPods die and they became cheaper
4728,5.0,I suggest getting some in-ear rubber hooks if they seem fairly slippery as they can improve the quality with some added bass
4729,5.0," Not drastic but good enough, noticeable difference, and they won’t slip and fall out when you’re working out"
4730,5.0, :)
4731,5.0,These stay in
4732,5.0, They sound good
4733,5.0, FINALLY I found a pair that work
4734,5.0, I tried several brands of ear pods for under $50 as I didn't want to spend so much on something that I felt is easily lost
4735,5.0, Every other pair fell out and frankly I don't want 100% noise cancellation when I'm out in public because I just don't feel it's safe not to be aware of your surroundings
4736,5.0, I am SO glad I took the plunge and splurged on these
4737,5.0, They pair easily
4738,5.0, They are comfortable (4/5 rating)
4739,5.0, They are easy to store safely on my Apple watch attachment
4740,5.0, Sound quality suits me just find
4741,5.0, I'm using them for my skype meetings at work with no problems
4742,5.0, And they do not fall out
4743,5.0,I've always wanted to own a pair of airpods
4744,5.0, So I opted in ordering from amazon considering they're cheaper
4745,5.0," I'm also an Samsung user so I wasnt sure if they would work,but I'm here to tell you they did"
4746,5.0, They pair easily and have excellent sound quality
4747,5.0," The only thing I would say is you do lose out on some of the controls such as ""Hey Siri"""
4748,5.0, After reading the reviews and questions I heard some say that they're fake
4749,5.0, Which is absolutely not true
4750,5.0, They are the real deal
4751,5.0," They came in a apple box with all the instructions and even have the model number and sign on the back that says ""Designed by Apple"""
4752,5.0," If you are considering buying these I definitely recommend, but keep in mind these are the series 1 airpods"
4753,5.0, Overall they are a better price than buying from apple and offer the same quality
4754,5.0, I was scared getting these because I thought they were going to be fake but they are not fake
4755,5.0, So happy that I got them for a good deal instead of going to somewhere else to get them for a lot more
4756,5.0," Ok overall, they’re not fake they’re real and quality is good the batteries for the earbuds and the case was 79% and 76% which was pretty"
4757,5.0, I’m so excited these are my first pair and I am looking forward to see how well they work
4758,5.0,"I usually don't write reviews, so when I take the time to do so, it is because the product is very good"
4759,5.0, I love these earphones
4760,5.0, I use them primarily when my husband and I are on trips in the car
4761,5.0, He listens to his own phone and I use the headphones to listen to mine
4762,5.0, The AirPods block out virtually all outside noise
4763,5.0," The sound is amazing and, although I haven't actually checked the battery life, the headphones last for what seems like a very long time"
4764,5.0, I would recommend the purchase without hesitation
4765,2.0,"They are okay wireless headphones, when they work"
4766,2.0," Every other day, I lose connectivity and have to restart my phone or go through a long process to reconnect"
4767,2.0, It is very frustrating when you are on the move
4768,2.0,I only purchased these because my LG wireless headset finally broke after 4 years
4769,2.0," I was going to purchase another one, but the cost difference was about the same"
4770,2.0," After using the AirPods after a week, I much rather prefer my LG Tone headset"
4771,2.0, Better quality and functionality
4772,2.0,"There some features I like, such as Siri, and immediately pausing sound, but that doesn’t make up for the flaws"
4773,2.0," Lose one piece, have to buy the whole kit"
4774,2.0," It can be a chore to keep track of these things, taking them off when not in use and you are moving around"
4775,2.0,Get this if you want an Apple fashion accessory
4776,2.0, Otherwise there are better products out there
4777,1.0,My purchase was Aug 2020
4778,1.0," About 3 months ago, they started not producing sound out of both pods"
4779,1.0, then they worked for awhile
4780,1.0," Now, I have been only getting sound out of one pod and then the next time I use them, it might be the other side"
4781,1.0, This has been going on for about 3 months
4782,1.0," Yesterday the connection was horrible, staticy and i switched to regular wire earbuds"
4783,1.0, I purchased a knock of these for $29
4784,1.0,95 several years ago and they lasted just about as long as this $129 set
4785,1.0, I would NOT purchase Apple brand again for lack of how long they have lasted
4786,1.0, VERY disappointed
4787,5.0,I had a hard time imagining how these could be better than other Bluetooth headphones I’d tried but they are
4788,5.0, The noise cancelling isn’t great but it’s enough that I don’t need to blast the volume
4789,5.0," I use these constantly around the house, at work, running errands"
4790,5.0, The sound quality is pretty good
4791,5.0, I regularly use them for zoom and conference calls
4792,5.0, They paired seamlessly with my iPhone and iPad
4793,5.0, Highly recommend
4794,4.0,The sound quality is wonderful
4795,4.0, The low tones are deep and rich and the higher frequencies are not screechy
4796,4.0, I gave 3 stars for noise cancelation cos I can still hear and understand a nearby conversation but with my Sony headphones I can tell someone is talking but I can’t follow what they’re saying
4797,4.0, The battery life is great
4798,4.0, I went in an 8 hour road trip and watched 6 Netflix shows without needing to recharge them
4799,4.0, The fit is not great
4800,4.0, The left earbud is significantly smaller than the other and I had to purchase silicone covers to keep it from falling out while doing simple activities
4801,4.0,Easy to use
4802,4.0," I just opened them and they automatically connected to my iPhone, i bought this to workout listening to jams and the sweat doesn’t make them come off or move out of place"
4803,4.0,One small note on delivery
4804,4.0,The prime guy took the picture of my package outside my door but kept the box to continue delivering to another doors and then he saw me arrived and he told me that he forgot to leave the box And handed it to me then
4805,4.0, I don’t know that was kinda suspicious
4806,4.0, Was he gonna keep my AirPods
4807,5.0,Love my new iPods
4808,5.0," The sound is good, there’s no noise canceling to them but still does it’s job well"
4809,5.0," I had before bought the JBL wireless pods due to the great price, which I still have, the only issue I had with those was that the pods would fall out easily out of my ears and almost had a clogging sensation when I put them in, rather when I put my ipods in, they fit perfectly and won’t move much at all and stayed in place"
4810,5.0," (I have small ears) Also, I read a lot of these reviews on these saying these iPods are fake or dirty or whatever and I got legit iPods in the box, plastic cover and all, so they are real"
4811,5.0, Those people saying they are fake or defective probably got them from a 3rd party seller so my suggestion is to buy them off amazon prime itself and not third parties
4812,5.0, Overall I’m super happy about my purchase
4813,3.0,Love the sound quality
4814,3.0," I’ve messed around with other headphones for a long time, they all distort voices"
4815,3.0, I really just use them for talking on the phone
4816,3.0, I also really like the charging case
4817,3.0," Unfortunately, with first pair I was sent, the left one stopped working in a few weeks"
4818,3.0," I reset it, it happened again a while later"
4819,3.0," Then the right one went out, so I returned and repurchased (with AppleCare extended warranty)"
4820,3.0, But the left earbud on the new pair went out within a few days
4821,3.0," I reset these, will wait and see if it holds"
4822,3.0, There should not be this much of an issue with new earbuds
4823,3.0, Glad I have the extended return window
4824,5.0,So far like these a lot
4825,5.0, Use them every day at work when listening to music for a 4 hours
4826,5.0, Then lunch with them charging and then another 4 hours of listening while working
4827,5.0, Charge time is about accurate
4828,5.0, 15 minutes or less charge time
4829,5.0, I did have one instance when I thought my right one was dying quick
4830,5.0," But after one day it ran out of battery completely and I charged it right away, it was normal"
4831,5.0,"One thing I would say, I can’t tell the difference between noise canceling but that might be just my ears"
4832,5.0," Other than that, you get a nice case for it or silicon cover like my Hello Kitty one"
4833,5.0, Now you have a personalized one for yourself
4834,5.0, Love the product so far
4835,5.0,This is a good product if a little overhyped
4836,5.0, Comfort is good but not great
4837,5.0, The sound is good but not great
4838,5.0, The noise cancellation is very good
4839,5.0, Used for the phone I usually only put one ear in and I’m told it sounds great and I can hear good
4840,5.0,The only things - my trucker headset I can say answer phone and it does
4841,5.0," This doesn’t, so I have to actually answer my phone and it will often switch out of airbud mode and go to phone for phone calls"
4842,5.0, I’m looking for hands free and this kinda fails on that one
4843,5.0," And lastly, way overpriced"
4844,5.0,My friend who I talk to on the phone every day tried a bunch of cheaper brands and we would always have trouble hearing each other or they would break
4845,5.0, Then she got these and we both noticed a big difference
4846,5.0, So I got some for myself and am very happy with them
4847,5.0, They are worth the extra money
4848,5.0, Sound quality is great
4849,5.0, It is easy to have a conversation in the car or while walking or doing other things
4850,5.0," Get the rubber cushion thingies too, or the newer version that has them built in, or you might have trouble with them falling out"
4851,5.0, I never leave them in more than an hour and the battery lasts at least that long
4852,5.0,"Truthfully, I waited a very long time to buy AirPods"
4853,5.0," I was concerned with their battery life, their ability to fall out of my ears, and especially their price"
4854,5.0," When I purchased the headphone jack-less iPhone 8 though, I knew it was time to switch"
4855,5.0,I love them
4856,5.0, Their battery life is very impressive and you can charge just the case which is super cool
4857,5.0," I didn't think the increased range of mobility would be that big of a deal, but it is so convenient to be able to have a greater range of motion while running"
4858,5.0, I can even cook and clean very easily all with music and not worrying about being attached to a phone
4859,5.0," After trying them, they do feel pretty secure in my ears"
4860,5.0," Also, the sound quality is immaculate compared to my previous 20 dollar corded headphones"
4861,5.0, I'm going to college next year so I'm super excited ill be able to have complete focus even if others are making noise
4862,5.0, My music is so clear
4863,5.0,"For all my skeptics out there, if you can afford them of course, they are a great purchase"
4864,5.0, I recommend
4865,1.0,I purchased these for when I am working
4866,1.0," When I take them out of the case, they'll both say they are at 100%"
4867,1.0," I will use them and about half an hour into use, the right airpod will have no battery life left, while the other one will be down to about 75%-71% battery life"
4868,1.0, I didn't do anything out of the norm with them to drain the battery
4869,1.0," If this is the way all of them are, I would not recommend getting these to anyone"
4870,1.0, I wouldn't want anyone to have to go through what I am having to deal with with my own
4871,4.0,The battery doesn’t last long and doesn’t give you much warning before it dies
4872,4.0, I don’t know where to see the battery life other then to ask Siri
4873,4.0," Also can’t be connected to multiple devices at once, not to my knowledge at least"
4874,4.0, I had a set (with wire) for $10 from Walmart that did and it was really nice during working hours
4875,4.0,"However these are super convenient, no wires to get tangled"
4876,4.0, When you remove an ear bud it automatically pauses for you
4877,4.0, This is its redeeming feature
4878,5.0,This is my second pair of airpods
4879,5.0, The first pair I bought new on eBay and thought I was getting genuine Apple ones but they turned out to be fake and are of awful quality
4880,5.0, I've been supremely pleased with the ones I got from Amazon
4881,5.0, They connect to my phone the instant I pop them into my ear and stop playing the second I take one out which is a super feature when a family member talks to me
4882,5.0, No fumbling with the volume button on my phone
4883,5.0," The fit into my ear isn't great and I'm going to look into something that will help that out, but overall, I'm very satisfied and definitely recommend this product"
4884,4.0,Android user here - Galaxy S9
4885,4.0,"Complaint 1- is at the gym with a high concentrated amount of other Airpod users roaming about, that it seems to suffer from interference of some sort"
4886,4.0," Anywhere else where there might only be a few people also wearing airpods, it seems to be fine"
4887,4.0," But if you get too many in one place, I've noticed it skips, or seems to get interrupted by something"
4888,4.0," It's not the internet speed, or cell signal, I've gone earlier when less people, no problems"
4889,4.0,"This might have something to do with Apple product on an Android device - As a coworker who visits the same gym, has no problem and he runs apple tech / phone"
4890,4.0,Complaint 2 - Being on android - you can't see remaining life on your airpods - So you have to just guess when you need to charge it
4891,4.0, Not a big deal
4892,4.0, But is slightly annoying to not know whether or not you can go without charging
4893,4.0, On apple devices you can easily see battery life remaining for it
4894,4.0, - Confirmed by friend who has apple
4895,4.0,Other then that - It's a surprisingly good
4896,4.0," As a Non apple fanboy, it's good"
4897,4.0," Stays in your ear even while running, jogging or doing most gym exercises"
4898,4.0, Just
4899,4.0, $150 is a bit pricey for my liking
4900,4.0," but I'm getting good use out of them, so was an alright purchase in my books"
4901,5.0,A great price on this unit was the main reason for getting the AirPods
4902,5.0, Apple's reputation for quality products was another reason
4903,5.0,The sound is terrific and the units charge quickly in the case
4904,5.0, The case itself also holds a charge well and re-energizes fast
4905,5.0,"Unlike some units, these rely on the Iphone or IPad to adjust the sound level rather than using a tap or touch to do that"
4906,5.0, That really isn't a negative unless a user is more familiar with that method
4907,5.0, Great buy
4908,1.0,I actually really like airpods but this is totally unacceptable quality control
4909,1.0, It seems every time I go to use them I have to re-pair them with my phone because the left airpod is not working for whatever reason
4910,1.0," Today upon trying to fix them I am now receiving a red exclamation mark, even after re-pairing and re-setting several times and checking the bottom of the pod and the case for debris or damage"
4911,1.0,I didn't pay $200 for headphones that are going to quit working after 10 uses
4912,1.0, No one would pay $20/use no matter how much they like the experience when it actually works
4913,5.0,They were brand new and a lot cheaper than Apple was selling them for (I bought them on sale)
4914,5.0, I use them most days
4915,5.0, These are my second pair of AirPods
4916,5.0, They only last about 18 months or so before they don't hold a charge long enough to be useable
4917,5.0, The updates with Big Sur and iOS 14 made them even better since they automatically switch devices depending on where sound is playing
4918,5.0," Sadly, this isn't perfect and the AirPods will favor my iPhone over my MacBook Air and they will automatically connect to my phone first when I have something playing on my computer"
4919,5.0,"First thing, I just got these in today"
4920,5.0," Second thing, don’t listen to the dum dums giving these a bad review"
4921,5.0, These are exactly what they say in the description
4922,5.0, They are not the wireless charging case and aren’t a lower quality case
4923,5.0, It’s the same thing you’d get at the apple store
4924,5.0," If you’re dissatisfied with not having the wireless capabilities, spend the extra $60 and stop regretting it on here"
4925,5.0,"Sound is crazy good, they block 95% of outside noise"
4926,5.0," Also, I wasn’t expecting this one, but you can fast forward through songs, pause the music and even change the song by tapping either EarPod"
4927,5.0," Oh, In case you were wondering, they’re new"
4928,5.0," Not tamepered with, or the wrong kind"
4929,5.0, Some of these reviews just wanted free stuff
4930,5.0,"I love them, never been fond of Bluetooth ear pieces because they were too big but these are perfect"
4931,5.0, The battery life is pretty decent
4932,5.0," I try to only use one ear at a time because they can block out sound, your ears will hurt if you wear them too long, and of one battery goes low I can switch to the other ear"
4933,5.0, The AirPod charging case battery lasts pretty long it’s the airpods that lose charge quick depending on how much you use them
4934,5.0, If you’re a heavy user I suggest putting them in charging case everyday and putting charger case on its lightning cord
4935,5.0, if not you can get away with charging them in the case without the lightening cord and only need to put the case on its lightening cord every so often
4936,2.0,At first I really liked them
4937,2.0," They stay in my ears and didn't hurt that much, and the battery life seemed to last for a long time"
4938,2.0, I've had them for about 6 months now though and they have stopped working the way they are supposed to
4939,2.0, When I want to use them I have to fiddle with them a lot to get them to work and most of the time only one ear bud is charged
4940,2.0, They don't pop up on my phone when I'm trying to see how charged they are and when they are charging only one of them is charging at a time
4941,2.0, I don't know what to do because it seems like a total waste of money to buy Airpods for $130 for them to only last 6 months
4942,2.0, Now I'm looking into buying new wireless earbuds but I'm definitely not going to be buy Airpods again
4943,2.0, :(
4944,5.0,Pairing is 100% painless
4945,5.0, They stop the audio when you take them out of your ear
4946,5.0, Saying Hey Siri if you want volume or song adjustments makes them hands free
4947,5.0, The sound is acoustically perfect
4948,5.0, At first the price was scary
4949,5.0," Now that I have them, I would have paid more"
4950,5.0, They fit my ears perfectly
4951,5.0, It’s too bad the star rating only goes to five
4952,5.0,Purchased for granddaughter 16th birthday
4953,5.0, Got the warranty coverage
4954,5.0, She never took them off Loved them till she list them at school
4955,5.0, She pinged them as explained online and goes where they are supposed to be but not there
4956,5.0, She was devastated to know extended warranty didn’t cover lost/stolen
4957,5.0, At the cost—can’t replace her loss
4958,5.0, Sad
4959,5.0,In ear headphones are tough for me - they are either uncomfortable or fall out
4960,5.0, These are not either
4961,5.0, I can wear them for hours and they stay comfortable
4962,5.0, As a runner the fear of them falling out was strong at first
4963,5.0," However, after YEARS of using my first pair, I never once had that problem"
4964,5.0," On the road or the treadmill, for hours of running"
4965,5.0, After about 5 years my first pair finally gave up on life and I bought these and they are much the same and I feel they are worth the investment
4966,3.0,"It is amazingly easy to pair these bluetooth earphones and to switch between devices, which is why I bought them"
4967,3.0," However, they are equally easy to knock out of your ears if you have long hair (so you may need to buy a cord to connect them and to hang around your neck)"
4968,3.0, My biggest complaint is the cruddy standby battery life
4969,3.0, If you leave them in your ears without any music playing the battery will still be dead in around 2 hours
4970,3.0, That is no where near the 5 hours of music per charge promised by Apple
4971,3.0, At this point I'm banking on durability to make up for the high price
4972,3.0, If these die in 6 months like all my other bluetooth headphones I will be furious and go back to cheaper alternatives with better battery life
4973,5.0,Pretty sure these are a fake knockoff or just super defective
4974,5.0," Bought them for my daughter for Christmas, she just heard me tell my husband I was going to order myself a pair & she told me I could have hers since she never sides them since they “too hard to use”"
4975,5.0, I asked her what she meant & she told me that they are difficult to pair to her phone & IF she can get them paired they always disconnect shortly after
4976,5.0, And she’ll charge them for a few hours & when she goes to use them the battery is dead
4977,5.0, Pretty bummed that we wasted almost $200 & it’s past the return window now
4978,5.0,"Pros: great sound quality, amazing battery life, that closing snap 😩😩"
4979,5.0,Cons: not much noise cancellation cover wiggles a tiny bit
4980,5.0,"Other than the cons above, I don’t know why people are so upset about these AirPods"
4981,5.0, They’re literally just 2nd generation AirPods by Apple
4982,5.0, They aren’t any cheaper built than regular AirPods you would’ve bought 3 - 4 years ago
4983,5.0, Stop hating on them they work perfectly fine
4984,5.0,I bought the Apple Air pods not expecting much
4985,5.0," But, I was impressed right away with the sound quality and ease of use"
4986,5.0," They pair very easily with my Apple iPad, iPhone and iMac"
4987,5.0, I find the sound tilted up a bit in the midrange
4988,5.0, That works perfectly with my hearing roll-off
4989,5.0," I can hear phone calls, videos, etc"
4990,5.0, way better now
4991,5.0, They are great for my streaming my Bandcamp purchases and they even pair fairly well with my Hiby R3 Pro and Hidiz players
4992,5.0, I am really glad I bought them
4993,5.0, My only complaint is they are very slippery and I fuss trying to get them out of the charger (also slippery)
4994,1.0,I actually own my own pair of AirPods but I decided to gift a pair on someone’s birthday
4995,1.0, The package was perfectly sealed and did not think to open it and check
4996,1.0, It was in the moment of opening gifts where it was noticed that no AirPods were found inside
4997,1.0, It was an embarrassing moment for myself and I had to play it off as it was a cruel joke
4998,1.0, Had to put out more money
4999,1.0, Was going to order another pair but Amazon somehow no longer had them
5000,1.0, I don’t understand how I can refund something but there was no product in it
5001,1.0, Very disappointed
5002,3.0,The sound is really good they work pretty well they connect easily however the battery life is really bad I don’t know if these were refurbished or not but I’m glad I purchased the AppleCare insurance with them because I’m gonna have to take them in soon so that I know I got my moneys worth because the battery life is really bad and I’ve only had them for maybe two weeks and the battery lasts maybe an hour for the course of the day which is really bad so you may want to go to the Apple store I don’t know
5003,5.0,Excellent Product
5004,5.0, I bought these airpods in new condition
5005,5.0, I've been using for 4 weeks
5006,5.0, I tend to use Bluetooth earbuds more than the average person because I'm always either making calls for work or am on Zooms and or conference calls from 8:30 am to about 9:45pm 6 days a week
5007,5.0, If you already own an apple product and are in their ecosystem then these premium priced headphones are an invaluable purchase
5008,5.0, If I knew they were this Good and would give added features to my Apple devices (iPhone 12 pro max & iPad 8th gen) then I would've paid their higher premium a long time ago
5009,5.0, Lesson learned
5010,5.0, If you're on the fence and are in the apple ecosystem my advice is to definitely get these airpods
5011,5.0,I'm very impressed with the AirPods
5012,5.0," My wife has been wanting me to get a pair for years, but I resisted (I'm on Android, so I knew I'd lose a bit of functionality - my wife has an iPhone)"
5013,5.0," But, I finally gave in when they had a good sale, and I love them"
5014,5.0," I wish there was a gesture that would ""jump back"" my playback, but at least double tap does a pause/play"
5015,5.0," Super comfortable, very long battery life, excellent sound quality"
5016,5.0," Even the charging case is excellent: not too small (to get lost), nice magnetic lid (doesn't open unless you want it to), good feel"
5017,5.0, The Apple designers know their ergonomics
5018,3.0,I’m hoping they work
5019,3.0, Was very disappointed with the way they looked when I opened the box
5020,3.0,Not sure why these would be sent out like this 
5021,5.0,These earbuds are great
5022,5.0," I was hesitant to get them at first, fearing they would fall out of my ears or I would lose them"
5023,5.0, They are secure in my ears whenever I wear them and carrying them around in the charging case makes it less likely to lose them
5024,5.0, I did forget about them in my pocket and ran them through the wash
5025,5.0, I took them out and they played normally right away
5026,5.0, I put them in rice for 72 hours and they still played fine
5027,5.0,"I have used these with my iPhone XS, Windows 10 laptop and iPad and for all devices they work great"
5028,5.0,I am still getting used to the commands/taps that come with these
5029,5.0, I would like to find more info on that
5030,5.0,"I bought these when they were under $100, which I felt was a steal"
5031,5.0, They are great to have
5032,4.0,I avoided these at first because the off brands were so much cheaper
5033,4.0, I was very disappointed in their sound quality though
5034,4.0, I gave in and bought these
5035,4.0, I don't know why there is a rating option for noise cancellation when these don't offer it
5036,4.0,Pros:
5037,4.0,"Wow, so much better range and clarity"
5038,4.0,So much better controls by having voice access to Siri
5039,4.0,They fit great in my ears and are much more secure than I thought they would be
5040,4.0,"So comfortable, I could wear all day"
5041,4.0,Cons:
5042,4.0,"Battery life could be better, but having the ability to quick charge in the case helps"
5043,4.0,Not available in black
5044,4.0,Should be more controls than double tap
5045,4.0," Triple tap for volume would be helpful so you don't have to yell out ""Hey Siri"" in the office"
5046,1.0,These KILLED my ears
5047,1.0," I had my husband and daughter try them to see if it was just me, but they hurt their ears as well"
5048,1.0, It's like they are shaped wrong
5049,1.0, The sound quality was what you would expect from W-mart specials
5050,1.0, Def not worth the money
5051,1.0, Do yourself a favor and upgrade to the PROs
5052,1.0, They are way more comfortable and the sound quality is sooo much better
5053,1.0, Plus the PROs have noise cancellation
5054,1.0, I was glad that Amazon allowed me to return them
5055,1.0,I recently tried 8 different pair of earbuds
5056,1.0," I wanted a pair that I could wear to the gym to listen to music while working out, but also be able to listen to music or news while working from home"
5057,1.0," Finally, as a secondary need, I wanted to be able to take calls on the earbuds too"
5058,1.0,The sound quality of the AirPods 2 awesome
5059,1.0," However, I can't enjoy the sound because the earbuds are extremely uncomfortable (even painful) for me to wear"
5060,1.0," Unfortunately, these are not a returnable item, so I am SOL"
5061,1.0," I'm looking into third party silicon tips to purchase, but at this price point I don't feel like I should have to"
5062,1.0,Bottom line
5063,1.0, I cannot recommend these
5064,1.0," I can however recommend Anker Soundcore Life 1, which feature a great sound, a very comfortable fit, and a price that is less than 1/2 the AirPods"
5065,2.0,"I hesitated a lot on reviewing this item for fear I wasn't being fair to the product, but I now can say with confidence that the sound out of these wireless airpods is definitely inferior to the wired earbuds for iphone"
5066,2.0, It's great that there are no wires attached and that's a plus
5067,2.0," I use them mostly when I am watching some series on my ipad, while walking on the treadmill"
5068,2.0," As far as noise cancellation, it doesn't work because I can still hear the treadmill in the background"
5069,2.0, Could my airpods be defective
5070,2.0," My son has a pair that he swears cancel all the outside noise, so maybe I got a floozie"
5071,2.0,"As an alternative, I am still using the wired earbuds while I walk on the treadmill"
5072,2.0,These were great for 5-3/4 months
5073,2.0, Then the charging got wonky
5074,2.0," Suddenly, after leaving the airpods charging overnight, one or the other airpod would give me a low battery warning 5 minutes after removing them from the case"
5075,2.0, Then the next charge would be fine
5076,2.0, Repeat whole process
5077,2.0, Very disappointed in this product
5078,2.0," Because of COVID, I can't take them into the local Apple Store"
5079,2.0," Instead, I get a $220 hold on my credit card, and wait for a refurb unit"
5080,2.0, I should have the hold removed once they get my defective unit back
5081,2.0, I won't buy these again
5082,2.0," If you do buy them, I strongly recommend the AppleCare (which you must buy within the first 60 days of placing your order"
5083,2.0,)
5084,1.0,"Received first set of ear pods in original packaging opened case white flashing lite charged case w/ear pods in checked white lite still flashing ear pods no charge, but when ear pods out of case green light comes on so case charges but not ear pods"
5085,1.0, Asked for exchange sadly for me the exchange came the same way
5086,1.0, Am I the only one who had this issue twice
5087,1.0, Buyer beware
5088,1.0, Amazon has been great they connected me with apple rep she could not help told me to get a refund
5089,1.0,I star rating I had none but could not post unit I rated star
5090,5.0,"Ok, I admit I tried to go the cheap route, not wanting to invest over $100 for earbuds, it's not in my wheelhouse, and I was afraid I'd lose them"
5091,5.0, Going with a cheap competitor was nothing but problems and was so frustrating I bit the bullet and got these
5092,5.0,What a game changer
5093,5.0," Connecting between devices is seamless, battery life stellar and I've never been happier with a set of buds"
5094,5.0," These are with me all the time, going from android phone, MacBook, pc, and iPad is so convenient I hate I didn't get these in the first place"
5095,5.0, I would recommend
5096,5.0,Unpack them and open them next to your phone or ipad and they simply pair
5097,5.0," I love how simple it is, i can jump them between my ipad and iphone with a simple 3 taps"
5098,5.0, I use them daily for music during walks but also for recorded audio of national parks and other ambiance that isn't very loud
5099,5.0, I find they last me about 4-5 hours for music and 6-7 hours for a low volume recording
5100,5.0, Drop them into the charging case and 20-30 min later they are ready to go again
5101,5.0, I've never had ear buds or headphones that were so convenient
5102,5.0,These wireless earbuds are amazing
5103,5.0," They have a smooth connection to your phone and the possibilities of what they can assist you in, in your everyday life to make things easier are endless"
5104,5.0," They make listening to music, podcasts, phone calls, and talking to Siri almost effortless"
5105,5.0, The 2nd generation Apple AirPods automatically connect to your phone through Bluetooth first thing when you open the wireless charging case
5106,5.0, The wireless charging case charges your Airpods just by inserting them into their spots and closing the case
5107,5.0, By charging your AirPods in the case for just fifteen minutes you have up to 3 hours of battery life in each AirPod
5108,5.0, Another feature that comes with the AirPods is being able to customize certain things of the wireless earbuds to how you would like them
5109,5.0, There are two ways you can customize them
5110,5.0, The first one is by choosing what you'd like engraved on the case
5111,5.0, The options of what you can engrave on them is limitless
5112,5.0," Some common things people engrave on them are their name, phone number in case they were to lose them, or a favorite quote"
5113,5.0, The other way you can customize them is by the name you want them under
5114,5.0," When your AirPods connect to your phone, it shows the name they are under on your phone screen and you can choose what you’d like that name to be"
5115,5.0, I love my 2nd Generation Apple AirPods and I can’t say enough good things about them
5116,5.0," If you are looking for a reliable wireless earbud, these are definitely for you"
5117,5.0,"The sound quality is good (not great), the noise cancellation in noisy environment is mediocre, but the battery life for how I use is fine (usually only one to two hours at a time, then back in the case for immediate recharging)"
5118,5.0," So, why the five star rating, because it works incredibly well with an iPhone, iPad, iMac, Apple Watch, no connection other than initial startup, instant recognition when you put it in your ear, great for phone conversation and zoom meetings, no wires (this is a huge deal), easily and comfortably fits in the ear for hours at a time"
5119,5.0, The case works great for hours of recharging before needing to plug it in and a great place to storage
5120,5.0,"With the exclusion of the headphone jack on iphones, air pods are a necessity for listing to music on the go"
5121,5.0,"Although I disagree with that design decision, these airpods are great"
5122,5.0,"They look nice, sound nice as far as I can tell (not very picky to be honest), and they're really convenient to carry around"
5123,5.0, They also don't fall out of your ear (I have average ears I guess(
5124,5.0,)) when you're exercising
5125,5.0,"Although you can find bluetooth earbuds for less, they're not in sync with the Apple/iOS environment like AirPods are so you may as well buy these to fit in"
5126,5.0,"so these are real gen 2 air pods - the light on the outside means wireless charging case - light under the lid means wired charging case not gen 1 airpods, if you look on apple you can see this"
5127,5.0, also if you look on apple 2031 and 2032 is gen 2 airpods not gen 1- the 31 and 32 does not mean gen1 speaker and gen 2 speaker
5128,5.0, don't believe it look on the apple website
5129,5.0, yes some are getting used airpods but not me
5130,5.0, these things are great
5131,1.0,Did not connect out of the box
5132,1.0," Took it to Apple, and confirmed not authentic Apple AirPods"
5133,2.0,To be honest I knew I would not like these before purchasing but I wanted to try something different (been using Beats X wireless since 2017) the wire makes them not so wireless
5134,2.0," But anyway, so I decided to give them a try because they were on sale"
5135,2.0, Here is my issue with the AirPods and every other Apple headphone made
5136,2.0,they hurt my ears
5137,2.0," No seriously if I have these things in for more than 10 minutes, they hurt"
5138,2.0, Why not make something softer
5139,1.0,"When these work they are awesome, but most of the time the right bud does not work"
5140,1.0," For a while I could get the right one to work by putting it back in the case for a few seconds, then putting it back in my ear, but that stopped working recently"
5141,1.0," Now I have to completely reset them every time to make sure I have sound on the right side, and even that isn't a guarantee"
5142,1.0," If I even pause my music, it can make the right bud stop working"
5143,1.0," The other day, the right bud had 0% charge even though they both had been in the case all day and the case still had more than 50% charge left"
5144,1.0, I've also been surprised at how quickly these lose charge when they do work
5145,1.0," If you decide to get them, make sure to return them as soon as you start having issues otherwise you'll be stuck with a faulty product and out $150"
5146,5.0,Hands down the best wireless in ear headphones
5147,5.0," Pairing with an Apple device is seamless, they auto pause/play when taking them out of your ear, they simply work all the time"
5148,5.0, Sound quality is very good
5149,5.0," Battery life is excellent and lasts almost all day listening, shorter life if using for talking"
5150,5.0, But a quick 10-15 minute charge brings them back for use again
5151,5.0, The only down side is they don’t block outside noise at all and are not great for air travel because of outside noise
5152,5.0, I also have AirPod pros which are perfect for blocking out the background noise
5153,5.0,"After settling for cheaper bluetooth headphones, I finally took the plunge and purchased these"
5154,5.0, They far exceeded my expectations and I'll never go back
5155,5.0, The only reason I marked 3 stars for noise cancellation is they really aren't built to do it--and they aren't supposed to
5156,5.0,"Side note: I accidentally washed them in the case in the washing machine, they were fine"
5157,1.0,"AirPods are over hyped, one of my worst buy that I ever made and here is my reason why"
5158,1.0,1st- didn't not charge correctly-one side will charge to 100% and the other side would be at 2%
5159,1.0, I tried everything in the book/youtube to make this work and nothing
5160,1.0, It charge at 100% when it wanted to
5161,1.0, This would hurt my workout times and had me super upset
5162,1.0,"2nd- sounds quality was horrible, wasn't loud at all and I could hear what was going on in the background"
5163,1.0, It just sucked
5164,1.0,"3rd- would fallout of my ears easily, any small bump and they're it went"
5165,1.0,4th-waste of money
5166,1.0,The only good thing that came out of this is that I'm now a proud owner of Beats Pro's
5167,1.0, They worth every cent and I haven't had to go through any of the issues that I had with the AirPods
5168,4.0,I bought this for my Wife she have a iPhone for that's reason sound good they are comfortable in the ears
5169,4.0,Things i don't like that much is not wireless charging case and not power break includes on the package and the case not have a light indicator outside just inside and you need to be open other time to checking out if their are charging or checking on your phone other brand have those things included and that is a letdown
5170,4.0,If after you is you want to buy it
5171,1.0,These AirPods r crap I bought them for my daughter birthday I gave them to her 2days early on her birthday the right one didn’t work wouldn’t charge up r anything I want my money back r I’ll get a lawyer for a $150
5172,1.0,"They were wonderful earbuds when I first got them, but after a while the sound quality was worse and one side stopped working"
5173,1.0, They didn’t work for phone calls and I would find that one earbud would be playing my music along with the phone playing music aloud
5174,1.0, I finally retired them (after only having them for 6ish months) when they were blasting music in a library
5175,1.0," It would be a better investment to buy a brand like Tozo, but I will never be buying AirPods again"
5176,1.0, This was my second pair in the last year (I treat my technology very well) and they are not worth it
5177,5.0,The airpods were on my daughter's Christmas wish list
5178,5.0, Her old ones were beginning to show some wear and tear in terms of sound quality after 4 years
5179,5.0," She didn't want the super new ones, which worked for my wallet"
5180,5.0, She was excited to get them and told me she is very happy she got them
5181,5.0, She says the sound is so good
5182,5.0," I say, if the older ones are still good and giving good sound, I would not just go with the new model just because it's new"
5183,5.0,My husband is ill and spends a lot of time in doctors offices and hospital waiting rooms
5184,5.0,hours and hours
5185,5.0," In the old days I would go with him and we would chat, but now in Covid land I am not allowed in the hospital or doctors offices"
5186,5.0,And I am sure you have all had the experience of the crazy lady who can spend hours chatting on her cell at the top of her voice
5187,5.0, It is torture
5188,5.0, So I purchased these for my husband to drowned out her voice and stay calm listening to music
5189,5.0," The perfect solution for drowning out people who don't realize that waiting rooms are for waiting, not sharing your entire life with everyone around you"
5190,5.0, Highly recommend
5191,4.0,Got these as a present
5192,4.0,Pros:
5193,4.0,Best connection out of any Bluetooth headphones
5194,4.0, Hands down
5195,4.0,Decent mic for calls
5196,4.0,Comfortable for most people
5197,4.0,Reliable
5198,4.0,Cons:
5199,4.0,Sound quality is fair
5200,4.0," Not terrible, but not great either"
5201,4.0,Should include wing tips
5202,4.0,Should come with charging block
5203,4.0,"Overall, these are convenience Bluetooth headphones"
5204,4.0," If you want simple reliability, these can't be beat, but be aware, there are plenty at this price point with better audio quality, but generally lack a strong Bluetooth connection, compared to airpods"
5205,5.0,"With all honesty, and fairness"
5206,5.0, Kid u not before I purchased these Apple earbuds
5207,5.0," I purchased more than 8, different types of earbuds, spend a lots coin’s"
5208,5.0, All had different effective problems
5209,5.0, But when I decided to go with Apple air-buds
5210,5.0, I wish I could get all my money back from all the others
5211,5.0," There is a saying, once you go black you can’t go back"
5212,5.0," Mine is once you go Apple Air Buds, you can’t go back to anything else"
5213,5.0, And that is the fact
5214,1.0,"I wish I would’ve returned these while I still had the open window, now too late"
5215,1.0, The batteries are constantly running low
5216,1.0, When I charge the actual case it seems the battery gets drained & then when I think it’s fully charged the ear buds are fully dead
5217,1.0, Constantly disconnects from allowing me to see the battery percentage & when I do get to use it usually only connects to the right bud and not the left
5218,1.0," Super annoying, I hate these and now I’m stuck with them"
5219,1.0," I used to have a great set from apple but my dog chewed them so I thought purchasing these from Amazon would be a great replacement, wrong"
5220,1.0, The sound is great and same to my old ones just the battery & constant disconnect is the issue
5221,5.0,With COVID forcing my employer to send us all home to work remotely
5222,5.0, I was using my gym headphones for conference calls
5223,5.0," I finally decided to give in and purchase some Airpods after I came to terms with the ""new normal"""
5224,5.0," (I can't fully express my distaste for that phrase ""new normal"")"
5225,5.0," Anyway, I digress, I was skeptical if they would stay in my ears comfortably as I have ALWAYS had issues with headphones staying in while working out"
5226,5.0, They work perfectly for both conference calls and gym time
5227,5.0," My calls are clear for both myself and those listening, and when I work out (and run) they stay in without me having to mess with them"
5228,5.0," Also, with my pumpkin spice lattes, Ugg boots, and now Airpods I can truly take my ""basic"" look to a whole new level"
5229,5.0,I bought these instead of the $250
5230,5.0,00 new model because I don't like things sticking in my ear canal
5231,5.0, I have owned 2 or 3 pairs of various brands that stick in your ear canal
5232,5.0, They were all uncomfortable
5233,5.0," These hang in your ear, you almost can't feel them"
5234,5.0, The sound is just awesome
5235,5.0, I am a retired Electrical Engineer
5236,5.0, I worked with a lot of sound equipment over the years
5237,5.0," This style of earbud, and the wired version of the same shape, is something Apple did right"
5238,5.0, I would have bought the $250
5239,5.0,00 model if it hung instead of having to be jammed in your ear canal
5240,5.0,I ordered these on Prime day because I just couldn’t resist
5241,5.0, My package arrived a day before the estimated date so I couldn’t be more excited
5242,5.0, Great so far except I can’t seem to get the double tap function down
5243,5.0, I’m not sure if it’s not working properly or if it may just be user error
5244,5.0," Also, it states in the product description that this IS the WIRED version"
5245,5.0, It seems that there may be confusion about this feature
5246,5.0, This has been my first day using them and I will make sure to update this review if anything changes
5247,5.0, These AirPods appear to be authentic after verifying the serial # on the official checkcoverage
5248,5.0,apple

5250,5.0, It states they are indeed the 2nd generation
5251,5.0,", I’m not sure if people are getting used/ refurbished AirPods after sending them back as a return, but mine seemed to be in the original packaging and untouched"
5252,4.0,ordered these the 1st day they were available and received them today
5253,4.0, They connected easily but on the 1st song I played the audio started slowing down less than a minute in and distorted the vocals and music
5254,4.0, I thought maybe it’s just a glitch because they are only 75% charged so I charged them up and reconnected them and it was even worse than before
5255,4.0, I called Apple support and spoke to 2 women who were beyond slow and the opposite of geniuses
5256,4.0, I was told the 2nd one was a senior supervisor not sure what her qualifications were as she was as inept and unhelpful as her subordinate
5257,4.0, After 37 minutes on the call timer and being on hold over 5x I hung up
5258,4.0, I’m going to the Apple store tomorrow
5259,4.0, So I went to the Apple store and with help from the guys there we were able to determine the music issue only happens with Amazon music - which is my service of choice
5260,4.0, I’ve been checking everyday for an update to fix this glitch
5261,4.0, Apple said they will take them back if one doesn’t come out in the next week or so
5262,4.0, I hate being a casualty in someone’s else’s war
5263,4.0,😕
5264,4.0,Alright there is a workaround - Settings-Amazon Music-Turn Microphone to Off
5265,4.0, Then when you pull up Amazon Music deny permission for microphone access for Alexa
5266,4.0, It fixes the distortion issue when playing music but then I have to turn it back on when I’m using it in the car
5267,4.0, So I’m updating my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars
5268,4.0, If they release an update so I can use Alexa again I’ll raise it up higher
5269,5.0,We now own 3 pair of apple air pods
5270,5.0, I have purchased other brands of earbuds and the sound and battery life don’t hold up to the apple brand
5271,5.0, Don’t waste your money on a less expensive brand
5272,5.0, You will get what you paid for
5273,5.0, I also love the fact that I can talk to Siri through these without having to dig out my phone and the caller on the end can hear me just fine
5274,5.0," My husband owns a different brand of earbuds and when Im on on the phone while he’s wearing them, it sounds like he’s under water and I can’t understand what he’s saying"
5275,5.0, These are definitely worth the money
5276,2.0,I did not care for the way these fit in my small ears
5277,2.0, But I was committed to making them work because they weren’t cheap
5278,2.0, My first outside walk I adjusted my hat and the right one fell out into the snow
5279,2.0, There’s only one thing harder than finding a needle in a haystack
5280,2.0, Finding a white AirPod in a snow bank
5281,2.0, I hadn’t registered them in the cloud so I couldn’t ask for where they were and I don’t think I could have found them anyway
5282,2.0, So $129 down the shoot
5283,2.0, I purchased another brand that loop around my ears and I like them a lot better so I guess it’s OK
5284,5.0,I know what you're thinking
5285,5.0, Use that little Apple app thing and you can find these in a flash
5286,5.0, Here's where things get weird
5287,5.0, I don't have an iPhone
5288,5.0, I have an Android phone
5289,5.0, What does that mean
5290,5.0," It means that every time I pop one of these babies out and put them down, IT'S EASTER IN MY HOUSE"
5291,5.0,Is the air pod under the couch
5292,5.0, Nope
5293,5.0,Is it on the window sill
5294,5.0, Nope
5295,5.0,Did I leave it on the counter at the store
5296,5.0, Nahhhhh
5297,5.0,In the bathroom
5298,5.0, Not there either
5299,5.0,I guess I'll just go and get the other one out of the case for now
5300,5.0, SON OF A
5301,2.0,I bought my airpods on Feb
5302,2.0," Didn't use them until March because it was a present for my hubby, well now I was listening to them and the right air pod went dead"
5303,2.0," I figured, maybe I just need to charge them"
5304,2.0," So when I got home I charged them, and the next day I went to use them again and the right air bud was still dead"
5305,2.0,"I put them to charge and when I went to retrive them from the case I notice the one with the issue was stuck and felt very hot, it overheated (melted) and now it's completed dead"
5306,2.0, Very dissapointed
5307,2.0,I chatted with an Amazon customer service and explained the problem and he was a ble to assist me and said he would send a repacement and exchange the bad ones for some working airpods;He made my day
5308,2.0, Thank you Amazon
5309,5.0,I got this set of Apple AirPods to replace my version 1 that started to give out after one year of usage
5310,5.0,Either the iOS updates or just the 1st generation going out
5311,5.0, Oh well
5312,5.0,"Anyways, I got the 2nd version for $129 at Amazon"
5313,5.0,"It was brand new, sealed and works great"
5314,5.0,"However, you all should know"
5315,5.0, The 2nd version uses battery out of the charging case much more / faster
5316,5.0, I have noticed that I do not get the amount of charges out of the charging case as with my 1st generation
5317,5.0,"I guess, welcome to updates"
5318,5.0," The sound is good, could be better, thought"
5319,5.0,"I love the touch actions on the AirPods of the 1st & 2nd generation versus ""squeezing"" the AirPods of the Pro version"
5320,5.0,i got these and i dont hate them
5321,5.0," of course they look cool and give you bonus popularity points, however there are a few things that i personally dont like"
5322,5.0," as the battery life goes does, so does the sound quality"
5323,5.0, i know it might just be a way to tell u to charge them but its honestly annoying
5324,5.0, second thing: the charging
5325,5.0, ik its easier than having to detangle earbud strings but having to charge them is annoying
5326,5.0, other than that these things work well and this is a safe place for buying them
5327,5.0,I resisted buying these for quite awhile because I didn’t want to spend the money
5328,5.0, So I bought cheaper wireless earbuds that didn’t have the sound quality I wanted
5329,5.0, I decided to ask my husband for them for Christmas
5330,5.0, These have the most amazing sound I can’t believe it
5331,5.0, I talk on the phone with people and it sounds like the person I’m talking to is standing right in front of me
5332,5.0, Not to mention how easy they were to pair and work which is typical of Apple
5333,5.0, I ended up buying a pair for my husband
5334,5.0, These are the best
5335,5.0, Don’t hesitate to buy them
5336,3.0,"I was replacing lost AirPods, as they work so well, and are superior to several other brands I’ve tried"
5337,3.0, But I am truly disappointed that the Airpod’s case refuses to hold a charge
5338,3.0," Left plugged in, it only achieves a 5% charge"
5339,3.0," Though the AirPods hold the charge hey are supposed to, the case is no back up at all"
5340,3.0, Will not buy from this seller again
5341,4.0,I received a brand new set of AirPods from this seller
5342,4.0," The Model Number of the pair is A2031, which is the 2nd generation model"
5343,4.0, The Hardware Version is 1
5344,4.0,0
5345,4.0,0
5346,4.0," (To get this information, open your AirPod case near your iPhone, then on your iPhone, go to Settings > General > About and scroll down to where your AirPod is listed and click on it to get the hardware/firmware information"
5347,4.0,)
5348,4.0,I'm disappointed that the battery doesn't last any longer than the first generation set I owned
5349,4.0, They go dead before the end of two back-to-back conference calls
5350,4.0," I haven't tried listening to music with them, so I have no idea how long they'd last doing that"
5351,4.0,None of that is this seller's fault
5352,4.0, These AirPods are being accurately portrayed here on Amazon as far as I can tell
5353,3.0,Sound quality is about the same as the wired ear pods
5354,3.0, They fit my ears perfectly
5355,3.0, I could wear them all day with no problem
5356,3.0, I've actually forgotten that I was wearing them a few times
5357,3.0, I like the convenience of not having to re-pair them across IOS devices
5358,3.0, What I dont like is the latency
5359,3.0, The sound is almost a second behind youtube videos played on my macbook
5360,3.0, The battery life is terrible
5361,3.0, I get about 5 hours even if I dont have audio playing through them the entire time
5362,3.0, I bought these to complement my Anker Soundcore Liberty Pro 2's which sound way better than the airpods but hurt my ears due to the tips being jammed into my ear canal
5363,5.0,I can’t believe I’ve waited so long to buy these AirPods for myself
5364,5.0, I borrowed my sons to go to the gym and I was hooked
5365,5.0," I checked on line and Amazon had the best price, shipped in one day"
5366,5.0," Came sealed in original Apple packaging, they work beautifully, sound super crisp"
5367,5.0, Same 2nd Generation as my sons
5368,5.0," No charging light in front, no problem, light on inside case"
5369,5.0, Comes with charging cord
5370,5.0, I bought the silicon case in picture and keep them on my keychain
5371,4.0,I have ridiculously small ears
5372,4.0, I always have a problem finding earbuds/pods that fit snug and don't hurt my ears
5373,4.0, These work ok
5374,4.0," Noise cancellation and sound is actually really good, I use them mostly when walking the dog"
5375,4.0, The battery life seems decent as well
5376,4.0," They haven't fallen out of my ears, but definitely became loose when just walking - not crazy walking, just leisurely walking my small dog"
5377,4.0," I've tried adjusting them in my ear every which way, but I just can't get that really snug fit"
5378,4.0," I've gone on to purchase silicone ear hooks to help, and so far those work just so-so for me"
5379,5.0,These are awesome
5380,5.0," I bought these for work when I had to make over 1,500 calls in 2 weeks"
5381,5.0, (I am a recruiter for a university & I was calling inquiries)
5382,5.0, Ever since then I wear them for work when making calls or listening to music and podcasts
5383,5.0, They’re also super convenient when cleaning the house or having a long call with family members when you want to move around
5384,5.0,I wouldn’t recommend for working out
5385,5.0, With that said I am beats loyalist because they have better sound quality and stick in my ears better
5386,1.0,You get about 90 days before they fail
5387,1.0," Some probably have better luck, I've had one set returned and waited around two months for an exchange and almost 90 days to the exchange these failed too"
5388,1.0,"Amazon says ""contact the manufacturer"", well that's a waste"
5389,1.0," I'd advise purchasing directly from the Apple Store or Apple, no need to play in the middle with Amazon"
5390,1.0,"$119, you'd expect at least a year of operation, I've two sets in about 8 months both fail"
5391,4.0,Got these back when they were on sale
5392,4.0, Works very well with my phone
5393,4.0," The case lasts for a long time, never ran out of power to charge them up"
5394,4.0, Doesn’t block out sound too well but works alright as long as your not being yelled at or around heavy equipment
5395,4.0, Take full use of having one bud in while the other charges for long phone calls or using as a mic in gaming apps
5396,4.0, Every once in a while one of them becomes disconnected and won’t connect back but unpairing and repairing fixes the issues
5397,4.0, They tend to last two to three hours after a full charge after heavy use
5398,4.0, I do recommend to apple users after trying out four other brands of true wireless headphones
5399,4.0, Not much for bass but just enough to hear it bump
5400,5.0,"The airpods 2 inherit the first generation design, and the appearance is almost the same as the old model"
5401,5.0," Same color, same material"
5402,5.0," But this time, apple put difference in the details"
5403,5.0,1
5404,5.0, Long battery life
5405,5.0, It can last for 24 hours with fully charged
5406,5.0, And the new charging box improves the charging efficiency of the headset
5407,5.0, 15 mins box' charging can get up to 3 hours of listening and 2 hours of talking
5408,5.0, It is 1 hour longer than the first generation airpods
5409,5.0,2
5410,5.0, Faster connection speed
5411,5.0," After adding the H1 chip,there is a big increase in connection speed when pairing devices"
5412,5.0," When pairing and devices switching, airpods 2 will respond twice as fast as the old model"
5413,5.0, It is easy to feel that
5414,5.0,The airpods 2 remain the best wireless earbuds on the market
5415,3.0,I wanted these for running but they don't even stay in my ears while sitting at my desk and there seem to be no provided options for adjusting them to fit
5416,3.0, I tried the various DIY methods to make them stay but I can only conclude they are made for space travel (only after attaining cruise velocity--no acceleration at all)
5417,3.0,The sound quality is great but I gave them to my daughter who liked them for a couple hours
5418,3.0, She regularly has to re-pair them to get them both working again
5419,3.0," Between that and the low battery life, she has given up using them"
5420,5.0,These are great
5421,5.0, i got them after i was very letdown by the galaxy earbuds (the ones that look like beans)
5422,5.0," fit in your ears great, stay in, after awhile i forget i have them in at all"
5423,5.0, the case will charge the buds
5424,5.0, this is the OG model so its not wireless charging but worth saving the extra cash if you can handle just plugging them in
5425,5.0, They have some cool features and if you pop one out your music/podcast stops playing which is a cool feature
5426,5.0,the noise cancelling isnt great but i also dont think they advertise them with that feature
5427,5.0,10/10 would buy again
5428,2.0,Only works great with apple products
5429,2.0," When you try to use with google Samsung galaxy note, the sound is very low and you can’t increase it"
5430,2.0, With Windows computers the sound also average
5431,2.0, So you couldn’t use this headset for business meetings if you have windows P
5432,2.0,C
5433,2.0,I think they make it on purpose so it only works great with apple products
5434,2.0,"When I use cheap headset with Samsung and windows devices, the sound 10 times better"
5435,5.0,"I wanted the wireless earbuds to avoid tripping over my cords while listening to music at home, and was so surprised by how much more these little gadgets had to offer"
5436,5.0," The design works seamlessly with Apple devices, pausing when you take an earbud out to talk to someone, pairing effortlessly, and the sound and function is fantastic"
5437,5.0, I also use these with a windows computer for online meetings
5438,5.0," It was a little clunky to set up at first, but they work great now for online meetings in a shared office space"
5439,5.0," The first time I connected them, they were very loud even on the lowest volume, but after disconnecting them and pairing a second time, they work great for the windows computer as well"
5440,5.0, So glad that I spent a little extra on these wireless AirPods
5441,5.0,I can’t figure out how else to get a message to you
5442,5.0, I used your UPS return label and inadvertently dropped it off at the US post office on Sunday
5443,5.0," When I realized my error, I went to the post office today and they told me it would be shipped on to you via USPS and I would be charged postage at your end, which is fine"
5444,5.0, I don’t know what else to do to get this back on track
5445,5.0, I returned them because I do not have the manual dexterity to get them in and out of the case and into my ears
5446,3.0,"I was excited to finally get these airpods, but they are so uncomfortable to wear (even for an hour)"
5447,3.0," The ear pieces are too big, which causes too much pressure around the inner part of my ears"
5448,3.0, Disappointing because the sound and call quality is great
5449,3.0, I do like that the airpods easily connect to my Nexus 5X and older imac before I upgrade
5450,3.0," The key to connecting an android device for first time with the airpods is to keep them in the case, press/hold the white button on the case while turning on phone bluetooth"
5451,3.0," Took a few tries, but now instantly connects"
5452,4.0,"I loved this product, it’s too comfortable, I don’t even realize I’m wearing it"
5453,4.0," The only defect is not to connect automatically, between my Apple devices, for example, when I want to use on the computer, and it was connected to the phone, I have to force the connection, the same when I want to use it on the phone again"
5454,4.0," To really get better, it was if the product could be connected to two devices at the same time"
5455,4.0,"Me encantó este producto, es demasiado cómodo, ni siquiera sé que lo estoy usando"
5456,4.0," El único defecto es no conectarme automáticamente, entre mis dispositivos Apple, por ejemplo, cuando quiero usarlo en la computadora, y estaba conectado al teléfono, tengo que forzar la conexión, lo mismo cuando quiero usarlo en el teléfono de nuevo"
5457,4.0," Para mejorar realmente, era si el producto se pudiera conectar a dos dispositivos al mismo tiempo"
5458,5.0,I bought these for my daughter who has a difficult time finding ear buds that fit comfortably in her ears
5459,5.0, We have tried many different types and none fit well enough to be comfortable or stay in her ears
5460,5.0, A friend let her try one of their AirPods and she loved the feel and that it stayed in place
5461,5.0, Definitely more expensive than I’d like to spend for earbuds but worth it after going through so many other kinds
5462,5.0, She is very impressed with the sound quality compared to cheaper versions as well
5463,5.0,"I purchased 2 of these units one for my husband, the other for myself"
5464,5.0, Love them oh so much
5465,5.0, They sound quality crispy clear
5466,5.0, Noise cancellation is on point as well
5467,5.0," They are extremely comfortable, most times I forget I’m even wearing them"
5468,5.0, Lol
5469,5.0," My husband has fallen asleep several times with them in, talk about comfort"
5470,5.0," Great price as well, highly, highly recommend buying"
5471,5.0," It’s a great idea being wireless since you get endless possibilities, and no restrictions"
5472,5.0, Get them already
5473,5.0,I love working late at night painting and listening to my jams as high as I want 
5474,5.0,loud enough so my ears won’t cry blood but in all seriousness BEST bang for your buck these ones
5475,5.0," Now I don’t answer my door when someone is knocking, I don’t hear the cars when I drive and now I have no friends lol music is all you need"
5476,1.0,No way to control the volume on these if you use them with a Fitbit versa
5477,1.0, AMAZING that you need to be connected to an apple iphone or watch to control the volume
5478,1.0, Too many other great options out there to force me to buy an Apple watch just to use these ear buds
5479,1.0,Bought these in June for a Christmas gift for my granddaughter
5480,1.0, They were packaged as new
5481,1.0," She opened, charged and tried them"
5482,1.0, Right one doesn't work
5483,1.0, We went to Apple for help
5484,1.0, Did everything but no luck in getting the issue resolved
5485,1.0, Kicking myself for not opening to make sure they worked
5486,1.0," BUT, they were packaged as new & I didn't think I should have needed to do a check"
5487,1.0, Now it's too late for exchange and I'm out the $ AND my granddaughter is super disappointed
5488,1.0, 😭😠
5489,4.0,This was the first time I spent a lot of money on earphones which was something unnerving for me
5490,4.0,Because I’m broke hahaha
5491,4.0,But I bought these mainly to workout or when I just wanted to enjoy watching videos or whatever
5492,4.0,When I received them they were amazing and I loved these immediately
5493,4.0,The only thing that I noticed how that it’s been 4 months is that since I have very small ears they have been prone to slip out very easily
5494,4.0,I swear a lot and again I have small ears so if you’re like me then it might be a difficult choice for you as they have fallen off my ear many times already
5495,4.0,They sound amazing and last pretty long as I have been able to use these for online school and they last pretty much the whole day except the last period
5496,4.0, Which is pretty impressive for something so small
5497,5.0,"Because of my job, I've had to deal with wearing bluetooths for the majority of the last 10 years, and I've detested every moment of it"
5498,5.0," After an hour of having the old style in, I'd be forced to move the bluetooth device to my other ear as they were literally painful"
5499,5.0," I got very tired of wearing bluetooth devices, to say the least"
5500,5.0," After reading the comments regarding the Gen 2 airpods, I decided to take a gamble and buy them"
5501,5.0, Am I glad I did
5502,5.0," I've only had them for one week, but the comfort of wearing them is off the chart, the sound quality is unbelievable, and the fact that the charging case will keep them available to me is wonderful"
5503,5.0, I took them to a friend's house last night and let him try them
5504,5.0," He's always been a huge audiophile and prior to putting them in his ears voiced his skeptimism as to how good these """"Itty-bitty"" airpods could possibly be"
5505,5.0," To make a long story short, I had to almost fight him to get my airpods back"
5506,5.0, Lol
5507,5.0," He let me know that he would be purchasing a pair of his own in the near future, and made mention of how unbelievably comfortable they were as well, and he had them in for a couple of hours at least"
5508,5.0, My $144
5509,5.0,"95 gamble definitely paid off, and I am very happy I made the jump to Apple"
5510,5.0,Absolutely the best thing I’ve ever gotten for Christmas
5511,5.0, These were for my daughter but my husband got me the same pair they work so WELL
5512,5.0," I use them when cooking, when cleaning, when doing laundry, on my walks"
5513,5.0, Highly recommend -
5514,5.0,In fact my husband has Bose wireless earbuds he says these sound better and are more comfortable in the ears and his were 2x as much in cost
5515,5.0, Buy a pair u won’t be sorry
5516,5.0,I am the only one in my family that is still uses Android
5517,5.0, My work phone is Apple and I hate it
5518,5.0, However the wired headphones that come with the phone are used continuously even on my Android
5519,5.0, I got tired of getting the wires caught on everything so I finally bought these
5520,5.0, Omg what was I waiting for
5521,5.0, I am super picky about earbuds and I bought this older version because they are the same as wired
5522,5.0, I know I wouldn't like the pro version
5523,5.0," Anyway, the sound quality is amazing, even better than the wired"
5524,5.0, I forget they are in my ears
5525,5.0, Pairing them with my Android was super easy
5526,5.0, Love them and worth every penny
5527,3.0,They came sealed and pretty much charged i am assuming they are new
5528,3.0, I read all the reviews about people getting used ones so i was skeptical
5529,3.0, The sound is a bit low but it could be due to the noise limiting i have activated it sounds louder when i turn it off
5530,3.0, They don’t seem to stay connected i will reset them and see how it works
5531,3.0, They also do not seem to stay charged long
5532,3.0, I had to reach out to apple in order to purchase apple care because it told me the Amazon purchase date was invalid
5533,3.0, Being that the return date has been extended i will try them out and see how it goes
5534,3.0, They don’t seem as loud as wired EarPods
5535,3.0,"AirPods are definitely very convenient to use, especially if you like to listen to music or videos while you’re working/moving around"
5536,3.0, Sound quality is standard and pretty much the same as the wired earbuds
5537,3.0, The battery life is really good and you could listen for the entire day relatively uninterrupted if you use one AirPod and swap when the battery runs low
5538,3.0," Even when I don’t use them for several days, the battery doesn’t drain so they can last a long while if you leave them around"
5539,3.0," However, there’s a frustrating issue that I’ve encountered more times than should be acceptable for rather highly priced earbuds"
5540,3.0, This is mostly relevant if you tend to only use one earbud at a time though; it’s not a major issue if you normally use both at the same time
5541,3.0,"The first pair I ordered came brand new and sealed, but within a few hours, they had already stopped working properly"
5542,3.0, The right AirPod would not connect unless the left was also in use
5543,3.0," Troubleshooting guides suggested resetting the AirPods, reconnecting, testing on other devices, and etc"
5544,3.0,", but nothing fixed the issue, and it was consistent throughout multiple devices (iPhone, iPad, PC)"
5545,3.0, I ended up returning these and requesting a replacement
5546,3.0,"The second pair I received, which is the one I currently own, worked fine for the first couple weeks"
5547,3.0," However, the issue from the previous pair started occurring with these as well"
5548,3.0," I decided to keep these despite the problem because unlike the first set, these seemed to function properly at least sometimes, so they weren’t consistently dysfunctional"
5549,3.0," Resetting the AirPods also temporarily resolves the issue, but this isn’t the most convenient thing to do when it 1"
5550,3.0, happens rather frequently (pretty much daily) and 2
5551,3.0," I have a case, and you need to hold onto the button on the back of the charging case to reset/reconnect"
5552,3.0," Also, weirdly enough, this pair had the connection issues with both AirPods"
5553,3.0," Sometimes the right wouldn’t work without the left, and other times the left wouldn’t work without the right"
5554,3.0," It’s probably a weird coincidence, but it always seems like the one I want to use at any given moment is the earbud that doesn’t want to connect without the other"
5555,3.0,"Anyway, I kept the second pair because they were functioning well enough, and I had purchased them for $99 which I guess isn’t too awful for brand new and legitimate Apple AirPods"
5556,3.0," But if the price was higher and I knew about this connectivity issue, which seems to be rather common judging from all the troubleshooting forums I found, I probably wouldn’t make the purchase"
5557,1.0,"Unfortunately, I had to request a refund because the AirPods would not connect to any of my devices"
5558,1.0, I thought that I could save a few bucks by purchasing the AirPods that were used but in good condition as they were supposed to be verified to work but this wasn’t the case
5559,1.0, I ended up requesting a refund on the used pair and ordering AirPods that were brand new on the same night
5560,1.0, The brand new pair worked great
5561,1.0," Fortunately, even if you buy the “used in good condition” ones that are verified by the seller and they do not work the return/refund process was very easy"
5562,5.0,"First of all, they’re legit & REAL AirPods -I got sold a pair of pretty real looking knock offs from a cell phone store in PERSON, so don’t be like me and be naive, there’s a tonnnn of people out there selling knock offs that look very similar"
5563,5.0, I verified the serial numbers on these through Apples website and all came back just fine
5564,5.0,"It should be noted these are NOT the wireless charging ones, however"
5565,5.0," I made a mistake and overlooked this in the description as some others have also, but I’m not bothered by it at all really"
5566,5.0,Worth investing in the 2 year Apple Care plan for the additional $29 or $30
5567,5.0," if you’re already dropping $120 on a pair of headphones, may as well invest in the coverage"
5568,5.0," esp in my case, I can see accidentally misplacing one or something lol"
5569,5.0,"Overall, very happy with this product and received within one day"
5570,5.0, They sound great and definitely worth the money
5571,3.0,Pros:
5572,3.0,Decent sound
5573,3.0,Easy to use
5574,3.0,Sleek design
5575,3.0,Long battery life
5576,3.0,Cons:
5577,3.0,Uncomfortable
5578,3.0,Do not work with Skype for Business
5579,3.0,I bought these so I would not be tethered to my desk when I am on Skype calls
5580,3.0, I guess I should have researched better as they do not work for this purpose
5581,3.0, I also found them to uncomfortable but I do not like the normal Apple headphones either
5582,3.0, I would imagine if you liked the original Apple corded headphones you will like these as they are similar
5583,5.0,"I bought ""regular"" air pods vs the noise cancelling air pods only because noise cancelling devices don't fit my weird ears"
5584,5.0, I love my air pods because I can listen to music or call people without interference from a long cord
5585,5.0," The sound is clear and, as a woman running at various hours of the day, I can still hear other sounds that would make me aware/beware"
5586,5.0," However, if I wear dangly earrings while walking and talking to someone, the other person hears the ""click-click"" sound of my earrings"
5587,5.0, No Big Deal
5588,5.0, I've learned to take off my earrings while walking and talking
5589,3.0,"Sound quality is really great, but does that matter when I’m exercising and the left one falls out and they stop playing"
5590,3.0, Flat or incline chest press - left one out
5591,3.0," Abs - you better believe they fall out, etc etc"
5592,3.0," So, my kid is taking these and I’m going back to my 4 year old mpow wired bluetooth which won’t fall out"
5593,3.0," Bottom line, if you don’t do much physical activity and you just something while at your desk or just sitting or walking around these will be perfect"
5594,5.0,These Apple AirPods are the finishing touches to my Apple Product collection
5595,5.0," Now the family is complete (Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple iWatch, and iPad Pro)"
5596,5.0, I’m so happy that I ordered them
5597,5.0, It switches automatically from my iPhone to my iPad just by pressing play on what I want to watch or listen to without me having to unlink and link them
5598,5.0," Plus, I can have Siri operate my AirPods (Start/Stop, Volume up/down, Skip track)"
5599,5.0, I can use either the Left or Right AirPod separately without the other
5600,5.0, I can check the battery 🔋 level for either/both AirPods by just putting the Charging case close to my iPhone
5601,5.0, And little box shows up on the screen
5602,5.0," I’m not sure what other features “if any” that they have, but I’m fine with what I’ve see so far"
5603,5.0, Money well spent
5604,5.0, I love them
5605,5.0,"I really, really debated on whether or not I wanted to spend the money on these"
5606,5.0, I regret not buying them sooner
5607,5.0, I tried the knockoffs and they sucked but these
5608,5.0, These are perfect
5609,5.0, They hold a charge
5610,5.0," I mean, really hold a charge"
5611,5.0, I keep my charging cable at my desk and unplugged it one day and forgot to plug it back in
5612,5.0, For a whole week I kept plugging the case into the unplugged charging cord
5613,5.0, A whole week
5614,5.0," I mean, I don't use them constantly but I definitely have them on for a couple hours most days"
5615,5.0, The sound is phenomenal
5616,5.0, No complaints
5617,5.0," If you're like me and you can't use most headphones because they insert into your ear and questioning the cost, just do it, you won't regret it"
5618,5.0,"I’ve tried another brand with much lower cost (around $40), but I don’t like them at all due to its poor quality accords all spectrums, then I returned it and purchased the Apple Airpods ($130), and it definitely standout without comparison, the sound quality is awesome, and setup is just a snap of finger, and Bluetooth connection is quick with just a click away"
5619,5.0," I do agree that Apple products are pricey, but sometime it’s worth the money with the quality built from Apple company"
5620,1.0,The earphones that came with my iphone 11 would not maintain a constant volume
5621,1.0, Desperate to listen to music Apple has designed a way to force you to buy the airpods
5622,1.0, But $29
5623,1.0,00 for corded ear phones that last non stop vs $129
5624,1.0,00 for airpods that usually discharge in 3 hours
5625,1.0, Profit margin for Apple
5626,1.0,I have owned these 4 months
5627,1.0, I use them almost daily
5628,1.0, Keep them in their case when not in my ears
5629,1.0, It seems charging is not going well after only 4 months
5630,1.0, Very frustrating to open your air pod case and find your right side only charged 3% and won’t hook up via bluetooth
5631,1.0, The left side has presented some of the same issue
5632,1.0, Really crappy when they falter after 4 months
5633,5.0,These are a game changer
5634,5.0, Such great quality
5635,5.0, They are comfortable and battery lasts a long time
5636,5.0, I always keep mine in my case so my AirPods are always charged and I charge my case every couple of days
5637,5.0," When it does need to be charged, they charge really fast"
5638,1.0,I bought a used “good” condition pair of AirPods from the Amazon warehouse for my little cousin’s birthday and they are a mess😂
5639,1.0, It’s laughable these are “good” condition they look bad like old and used
5640,1.0, I tried to connect them to my iPhone to se if they worked since I’m gonna paint them anyway so could sea With them being not good looking but one of them didn’t even work
5641,1.0, sending them back and just gonna pay the extra $30 for a brand new pair
5642,1.0, At least Amazon had brand new ones at a good price
5643,3.0,"Everyone loves these, I just like them"
5644,3.0," The pros are that they connect immediately to an iPhone, no issues"
5645,3.0, If you use an ipad they can transition sound from iPhone to the ipad
5646,3.0," The Cons, they make an annoying clicking sound on phone calls"
5647,3.0, It’s constant and very annoying
5648,3.0, The sound clarity is okay for $100 plus item
5649,3.0," The battery is poor, they last four hours, without constant use"
5650,3.0, You must charge these every two or so hours
5651,3.0,"I have a set of Taotronics ear pods that are half the price and hold a charge for eight hours, but they drop connection a lot"
5652,5.0,I have been searching for wireless earbuds for a good amount of time and surprisingly I am really satisfied with my purchase
5653,5.0, (My phone is an iPhone 6 Plus roughly 4 years old)
5654,5.0,Things I was looking for in wireless earbuds
5655,5.0,-sound quality
5656,5.0,-fast connectivity
5657,5.0,-battery life
5658,5.0,-sound quality when making phone calls/mic sound
5659,5.0,All of these were fulfilled when I tried it out
5660,5.0,I was really surprised on how fast the airpods connect and how I can easily tell that they are on
5661,5.0, It makes a sound when you put them in your ear
5662,5.0, I don't have to check my phone to see if they are connected or not
5663,5.0, I do not need a specific app to control the sound quality like other wireless earbuds
5664,5.0, I was also surprised on how easy it was to check the battery life of both the case and the earbuds
5665,5.0, Just have to open the case and see the screen and the battery life will show up on the bottom of the screen
5666,5.0, Some earbuds do not have the greatest mic when making phone calls
5667,5.0, You will not come across problems like that when using these airpods
5668,5.0, Battery life lasts a good amount for me
5669,5.0," I usually only use one out of the two airpods, when one of them starts going low in battery i just switch over to the other airpod"
5670,5.0, There is no struggle in trying to reconnect with the airpods just have to pop them in your ear
5671,5.0, Also if the airpods are low in battery it does fast charge when you put them in the case so it will easily charge half way within 15 or so minutes
5672,5.0, No sound leaks as well when using them even if your music is really loud
5673,5.0,Overall A+++ purchase
5674,5.0, Would recommend to anyone looking for wireless earbuds
5675,5.0,Recommendation for breaking in your new AirPods straight out of the lovely packaging: Luke Evans’ newish album “At Last”
5676,5.0," I have been enjoying this album for weeks, with plain old ear buds"
5677,5.0," But with AirPods, this album is something entirely different and unexpected, a truly astounding experience"
5678,5.0, I am now in awe of the musicians
5679,5.0," But it is Evans’ positively wrenching expressiveness, completely lost on me with cheap earbuds and speakers, that now, empowered by AirPods, pulled my very heart right out of my chest through my ears"
5680,5.0," Bravo, Apple"
5681,5.0," Bravo, Luke Evans"
5682,4.0,"I am not if it is just me, my airpods make cracking sound time to time when I was making phone call, the quality of sound is okay, the battery life is great, it lasts 3-4 days each charge"
5683,4.0," One thing I hate about it is that it is not working so well with my Android phone, no battery status, which is so inconvenient"
5684,4.0, Does apple expect everyone to use iphone
5685,4.0," Overall, it is great for the price"
5686,5.0,Bought for $129 at Costco
5687,5.0, Love them on day one
5688,5.0, I have an older car (2007 Honda Accord)
5689,5.0, I love this car so much
5690,5.0, It’s perfect
5691,5.0, In mint condition and paid for
5692,5.0, But I would love for it to have Bluetooth
5693,5.0, I have an Apple cord
5694,5.0, But these headphones are so much better
5695,5.0, I feel like I’ve spent the past (15
5696,5.0,) years with my phone on speaker on my lap
5697,5.0, This is soooo much of an upgrade if this is what you are doing
5698,5.0, You can drive with just one ear in and have total freedom
5699,5.0, I now vacuum and dust my house with these in
5700,5.0, The sound quality is amazing
5701,5.0," Seriously, this is some of the best money I’ve spent lately"
5702,5.0,Original Apple AirPods
5703,5.0, I like how they’re compact and automatically sync and turn on when you put them into your ears
5704,5.0," Best of all, no wires"
5705,5.0," They don’t stay in my ears very well, but neither do the earphones that came with the iPhone so it’s to be expected"
5706,5.0, I use the silicone covers for a better fit
5707,5.0, The only thing I hate is that the AirPod Pros came out a month after I bought these
5708,5.0," Those have noise cancellation that you can switch on and off, and you customize the fit, but they’re also twice the price"
5709,1.0,"I was given a pair of cheap Airpod ""knock-off"" brand airpod clones and was astounded how good they sounded"
5710,1.0, I thought if these are this good the real Apple Airpods must be fantastic
5711,1.0," To my dismay the Apple Airpods would not bluetooth connect to anything, not even my iMac"
5712,1.0," So I am sorry that I cannot include a sound quality rating or any rating, they just would not work"
5713,1.0, I returned them and will just be happy with my cheap brand
5714,1.0,I own a lot of Apple products but this is the one that I really didn’t like
5715,1.0, Not worth the money
5716,1.0," Doesn’t stay in ears, uncomfortable, and not good sound quality"
5717,5.0,People are high this fad saying the battery lasts 6+ hours
5718,5.0," True Bluetooth ear bugs last 6+ hours when you DON'T USE THEM, like for occasional calls"
5719,5.0, But for continuous music or audio books the battery doesn't last an hour
5720,5.0,"I forget the things in my ear, that's not a good thing"
5721,5.0, Noise cancellation
5722,5.0," Google ear bud block noise, these don't"
5723,5.0,I use tether ear buds that cost $10 now
5724,5.0, Sorry I bought into this overprice Bluetooth fad
5725,5.0,These fit much better than the newer and larger Gen 3 which I bought and returned to Costco
5726,5.0, Just didn’t fit well in my ears and I don’t have small ears
5727,5.0, I don’t notice a discernible difference in sound quality between gen2 and gen3
5728,5.0,I bought these for $99 here and another pair at Costco for $89
5729,5.0, These will sit in the box until my current ones die
5730,5.0, Stocked up before they were all gone
5731,5.0, They are that good to me
5732,1.0,I loved this product until it stopped working
5733,1.0,"I am able to hear the caller but the caller can only hear my voice very, very faintly"
5734,1.0,"When I called Apple to help with troubleshooting the problem, I was told that the serial number wasn't from a registered product and they can only assume that I was sold a knock-off"
5735,1.0,"I would like this resolved, I would like to have a product that works"
5736,1.0,I purchased the Airpods from Amazon on 4
5737,1.0,16
5738,1.0,20
5739,1.0, Serial number: GMVC67KJLX2Y
5740,1.0,Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter
5741,5.0,I purchased the AirPods and Airpods Pro
5742,5.0, I decided to keep the regular ones just because they actually fit my ear a lot better EVEN THOUGH the AirPods Pro have the adjustable features
5743,5.0, If it wasn’t that I would have probably kept the AirPods Pro
5744,5.0," The regular ones are annoying when you have to tap on/off, pause/start"
5745,5.0, the first tap never works
5746,5.0, Sometimes you have to tap like an idiot
5747,5.0, With the Pro it just always works
5748,5.0," If you like the noise canceling, pro ones are great"
5749,5.0, If you want to know whats going on around you the regular ones are better
5750,5.0, ( airpods pro do have an option of turning off the noise canceling but even with it off i felt like I still wasn’t 100% aware of my surroundings)
5751,1.0,I loved these
5752,1.0," Very handy, good sound and what looked like at the time good quality"
5753,1.0, That lasted four months and they simply sputtered for awhile then stopped completely
5754,1.0, I’ve always favored Apple products but no longer
5755,1.0, These are just short of a direct rip off
5756,1.0, I’m out 129
5757,1.0,00 and Apple is laughing all the way to the bank
5758,1.0, I suppose it doesn’t bother them in the least but they lost a customer that had dealt with them over 40 years
5759,1.0, This is the last time
5760,5.0,This is obviously a great product to use when on the phone
5761,5.0," However, I was tempted by these to listen to music whilst weeding without having to carry the iphone around"
5762,5.0, I should have done more research
5763,5.0," The range is a few feet, farther than that and the music just cuts in and out"
5764,5.0, The buds also don't stay in my ears as I move
5765,5.0, Back to the shuffle and headphones I guess
5766,5.0, My biggest gripe was that I never received the e-mail to start a free music trial
5767,5.0, I contacted Amazon three different times and their customer service was awful
5768,5.0, They claimed they couldn't see the deal on the product page-even had me send screen shots to prove it
5769,5.0, Made me feel like I was lying to them
5770,5.0, The deal is still there
5771,5.0, They never got back to me
5772,5.0,I only bought these because I had an Amazon gift card and I got a great discount and I love them
5773,5.0, I thought they were like the basic corded earbuds from Apple but they are so much better
5774,5.0, The sound quality is AMAZING
5775,5.0, I can talk for about 3+ hours before they need to be charged
5776,5.0, I still haven't a low batter from listening to music alone
5777,5.0, The charging case powers the AirPods back to full in 15-20 mins and I'm amazed
5778,5.0, The case gives me about 5-6 full charges before I need to hook it up to a charger
5779,5.0, I'll never used any other earbuds
5780,5.0,I purchased these to sync with a GPS mapping app on my phone
5781,5.0, The app is intended for cycling applications
5782,5.0, After setting up my route the app gives me turn by turn instructions while riding
5783,5.0, The air pods ensured that I never missed a turn over several days of cycling in both urban and rural settings
5784,5.0,The buds are comfortable to wear and remain very secure in my ears even while exerting myself on a bike and perspiring in hot weather
5785,1.0,The first pair I got I could not answer or hang up calls with one tap or 2 taps
5786,1.0," I reset them a couple of times, watched you tube videos to be sure I did this right - to no avail"
5787,1.0, I would have to run around looking for my phone to answer it while wearing the air pods
5788,1.0," Siri worked fine sending and receiving messages however, music and listening to podcasts was ok also"
5789,1.0, So I sent the first pair back to Amazon and got another set
5790,1.0, Same problem again
5791,1.0, Very frustrating
5792,1.0, I sent those back and Amazon refunded my purchase price
5793,1.0, Can't figure it out but not good for me
5794,5.0,I bloody love these things
5795,5.0,"I don't have an iPhone, I'm an android lady and I still love these things"
5796,5.0,"Sound quality and microphone quality are second to none, and they last forever battery, wise"
5797,5.0,"Admittedly that get a little sore in my ears after a few hours, but"
5798,5.0,hours
5799,5.0, And I have really small ears
5800,5.0,"I went through four other sets of headphones though again that were a fraction of the price and they all sucked in one way or another, and I ended up returning them, very disappointed"
5801,5.0, I sucked it up and bought these and never looked back
5802,5.0,If you're hemmin' and hawin'
5803,5.0,just buy them already
5804,5.0,Brand new iPhone earplugs
5805,5.0, Work as a charm
5806,5.0," Always used other cheaper brand but if you have an iPhone , I will recommend to buy iPhone earphones"
5807,5.0, It is worth the price
5808,5.0, Several options to use
5809,5.0, The only thing I was not give the option to buy the apple protection but is OK since price was cheap
5810,1.0,At first these headphones were great
5811,1.0, Then the new wore off
5812,1.0, I found that they were getting quieter and didn’t block out ANY ambient noise which for me was a huge turn off because I use music as an escape from the screaming of my family and shop environment
5813,1.0, Secondly about 5 months in the left side speaker blew
5814,1.0," Now for most people they wouldn’t be bothered but for me I’m kinda mad because i spent 150 dollars of my good money for this garbage that doesn’t sound good, and broke way before it’s duty was over"
5815,1.0," The fitment was also a big turn off, they would constantly fall out of my ears and were uncomfortable to wear"
5816,1.0," Then the bane of their existence, the case would load up with so much metal filings that it wouldn’t be able to shut and charge the dang things"
5817,1.0, I’d have to clean it out with alcohol once a week just so they would charge
5818,1.0," The only thing I liked about these was, how they looked, how they read texts to you, how they paired with your phone seamlessly and the sound they made when they hit the bottom of the garbage can"
5819,1.0, Avoid at all costs
5820,1.0, They’re a cheap headphone with premium features that’s why they’re so expensive
5821,4.0,I love these earbuds
5822,4.0," I have a few pair, and these make the others look like trash"
5823,4.0," Pairing couldn’t be simpler, they are lightweight and super comfortable, fit well, and couldn’t be simpler to use"
5824,4.0, These are great earbuds
5825,4.0,The reason I only gave them a lower rSting is the sound quality
5826,4.0," It’s not bad, but it’s also pretty far from great"
5827,4.0," The sound is nicely balanced, but lacks any punch"
5828,4.0," They do sound amazing with a few albums, but that is rare"
5829,4.0, The sound is usually flat and lacking dynamics
5830,4.0," Still, they sound good enough"
5831,4.0,"Overall, though, I am happy"
5832,4.0," I do recommend them, but with a caveat"
5833,2.0,I bought these as a birthday gift for my dad
5834,2.0, My dad kept complaining they keep falling out of his ear
5835,2.0," I didn’t believe him, so I decided to test them out myself"
5836,2.0,I tried them out listening to music while working and doing stuff around the house
5837,2.0, I also took them jogging
5838,2.0," They look really pretty, like most Apple products"
5839,2.0," They sound okay, but noise cancellation is non existent"
5840,2.0," They didn’t fall out of my ear, but they are not exactly secure either"
5841,2.0, It’s a weird feeling
5842,2.0," Sometimes I forget they are there and everything is great, but sometimes I’m constantly checking to make sure they’re secure"
5843,2.0," If they had the little rubber ear tips like most other similar products, it would have been much better"
5844,2.0,I’m not a big fan of the commands they implemented either
5845,2.0, For example you’re supposed to tap them to answer a call or play the next song
5846,2.0," Not a bad idea, but their implementation is underwhelming"
5847,2.0," Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t"
5848,2.0,Oh and Siri voice commands are disappointing
5849,2.0, Very hit or miss
5850,2.0,"Apple, you’ve got work to do"
5851,2.0, Frustrating product
5852,2.0, Don’t recommend
5853,1.0,Very disappointed that upon opening my BRAND NEW airpods that there were pieces of lint/hair inside the charging case
5854,1.0, Wtf
5855,1.0, Even if these were refurbished - which they aren't - it would be unacceptable to sell a dirty product to a customer
5856,1.0, How does that even pass quality control
5857,1.0, One airpod also has something weird going on with the mesh part where the sound comes out
5858,1.0, It's dark
5859,1.0," Idk if that's just a weird defect or ear wax, but I'm getting a replacement"
5860,1.0, Will update once replacement arrives
5861,1.0,Extremely disappointed in this purchase
5862,1.0, I ordered my first pair last year and they were perfect
5863,1.0," Brand new, never used, fresh packaging"
5864,1.0," I lost both head phones , silly me, and decided to reorder to ensure I got the same product"
5865,1.0, Boy was I wrong
5866,1.0, When I first opened the package I knew something was wrong
5867,1.0, The box was dented and not covered in the standard Apple wrap
5868,1.0, I open the AirPods and the first thing I noticed was the charging cord had a red stain on it and the right ear bud had ear wax on them
5869,1.0, At this point I was curious as to if they were refurbished or fake
5870,1.0," I clean them, flip open the case to begin connecting them and they say “Tash’s AirPods”"
5871,1.0,my names Leonah
5872,1.0,still curious I connect them and was greater with the connection sound which followed by horrific static and the sound completely dropping from the right AirPod
5873,1.0,Needless to say I will be returning these ASAP and going to the Apple store to buy a fresh pair
5874,5.0,I pace a lot when I am on the phone
5875,5.0, I also have to use my computer while on the phone a lot as well
5876,5.0, I've always loved the sound quality of the corded earbuds and so I never invested in the wireless ones
5877,5.0, Now that I have them I have to say I LOVE them
5878,5.0, They are flawless
5879,5.0, They connect instantly
5880,5.0, They last a long time
5881,5.0,I no longer accidentally disconnect when I drop my phone or move away from it
5882,5.0, And the sound quality is outstanding
5883,5.0, Love them
5884,5.0,I love love love these
5885,5.0, I have been wanting them since they came out and could not afford them
5886,5.0, Thanks to being $50
5887,5.0,00 off I was able to get them
5888,5.0, They are perfect
5889,5.0, My daughter got them all hooked up for me and wow
5890,5.0, SO SO SO good
5891,5.0, Calls are clear
5892,5.0, Music and audible books sound great
5893,5.0, I have been using the apple wired pair forever
5894,5.0, I have to untangle them all the time and they get caught on stuff
5895,5.0, I am so excited
5896,5.0,I had purchased the AirPods lil less then a month ago & they were working totally fine yesterday and then today I put them on & my left AirPods had sounded static
5897,5.0, I have tried to unpair them from my phone & had paired them to another phone thinking it might be the phone & the same thing
5898,5.0, & I had went to hit up the people I’d bought them from “amazon” & they had nowhere to contact them
5899,5.0, soo i am stuck with a $100+ head phones that sound like $hit
5900,3.0,I had the first generation that no loner held a charge
5901,3.0, I tried several high rated $40-$60 ear pods however they all sounded too bright
5902,3.0, So I bought another pair of Apples
5903,3.0," The sound quality was and is the best feature and for that, I really like them and glad I have them"
5904,3.0, The other few features work on and off
5905,3.0," They last, on a charge for, I guess, 6 maybe 8 hours ---> I am very pleased"
5906,3.0, They charge up fast in their rechargeable case
5907,3.0,"5 stars on the sound and size, 3 stars on the rest"
5908,3.0,I would buy then again
5909,5.0,Amazing accessory to an apple iPhone/iPad/iPod
5910,5.0," Like others, I had been perfectly happy with my wired, complimentary headphones from Apple until I tried these - game changer"
5911,5.0,"Whether you're listening to streaming TV, a podcast, music, or on a phone call, these airpods truly simplify the experience and have a good quality (assuming that you're not an audiophile)"
5912,5.0," Especially in the world of WFH, I find that I use these airpods (paired with my cellphone) nearly continuously for work phone calls"
5913,4.0,Battery life and charge speed are amazing
5914,4.0, Sound quality is great
5915,4.0," They don’t always stay in your ears if your moving around a lot but once you get used to them they are fine, they don’t fall out, they just feel like they are about to sometimes"
5916,4.0, I would recommend buying a case and skins for them if you are using them to work or workout as they get dirty very easily
5917,4.0, They pair instantly to Apple products which is convenient for the most part unless you are around a bunch of devices that you use at once then it can get annoying and you have to make sure you clarify which device your using or it might try to hand off every time you move from one to another
5918,4.0, Good solid sound quality and this coming from someone who does music production
5919,4.0," Regret not buying pros only because you only get 2 functions with the Left/Right tap feature on these, but otherwise they are great product overall"
5920,1.0,People can't hear me on zoom calls
5921,1.0, They say I should robotic
5922,1.0, I have tried zoom on my iphone and my computer
5923,1.0, Doesn't matter my voice is bad
5924,1.0, The charge dies within an hour and the sound quality for me is garbage
5925,1.0, I may have gotten a bum set because I've heard nothing but rave reviews from people
5926,1.0, But over all very disappointing and a waste of money for the set I have
5927,5.0,My son really wanted a pair so I told him if he purchased he could get and sure enough he saved until he could purchase
5928,5.0, He really loves these things at the moment
5929,5.0," Says they are great with sound and battery life, I do think he misses some of the features from his previous less expensive pair but all the kids have AirPods and that's what he had to have"
5930,5.0,Sure enough he hasn't been carrying around as often or using as often but he is using and sayings they are great
5931,5.0, Me personally not sure the money is worth the name and I'm an Apple gal always listening to my music
5932,5.0, He was uber excited for the arrival and the first week to show off but after that not so much use
5933,5.0,I resisted buying these for years thinking they were a waste of money
5934,5.0," Boy, was I wrong"
5935,5.0," They recently went on sale for $119 and I had just lost a pair of ear buds, so I decided to get them"
5936,5.0, OMG
5937,5.0, The are great
5938,5.0," They are discreet (I have long hair), have great sound quality, and are perfect for both music and talking on the phone"
5939,5.0," You have to plug in your case to charge the AirPods, but that does not bother me in the least"
5940,5.0," I use them daily, at work and at home, and I kick myself that I didn’t buy them a few years ago"
5941,2.0,My niece has had hers for a while and loved them
5942,2.0, So I thought I would give them a try
5943,2.0,The first issue I have with them is the battery does not last longer than 3 hours
5944,2.0," (That might be my bad, maybe they are not designed to"
5945,2.0,") If I am going to be on a call longer than 3 hours, I do like that i can use one earbud and the other can stay charging in the case"
5946,2.0, I do lose any noise canceling that it does that way
5947,2.0, In addition sometimes the one earbud will not have audio
5948,2.0," I have to put in and take it out of the case a few times to get it to work, so as long as I try switching the earbud before the one dies I can talk longer than 3 hours"
5949,2.0,The next issue I have is they do not always connect to my iPhone 11 and/or my Samsung Note 10+
5950,2.0, I actually have better luck with the Samsung than the iPhone
5951,2.0," Once I get the Samsung to connect it will almost always do so, the audio might cut in and out but they connect"
5952,2.0, The iPhone on the other hand will say it is connected but there will be no audio
5953,2.0," It is frustrating, maybe it is the two phones that cause the issues, I am not sure"
5954,2.0," I bought them because so many loved them, but I would not recommend them at unless you really do not talk long on your phone and only had one phone"
5955,2.0, Then maybe you would have less issues than I have had
5956,2.0,"These don't stay in my ears, I had to buy separate in-ear style pieces"
5957,2.0," They don't always connect with my iPhone and I have to ""forget this device"" in Bluetooth settings and start over"
5958,2.0, The auto pause function when removing from ears doesn't always work either
5959,2.0, (Very annoying when you lose your place in your audiobook
5960,2.0,)
5961,2.0, This happens whether I have the in-ear pieces on or not
5962,2.0," The sound quality is good, but I don't think there is any noise cancelling effect at all"
5963,2.0, I can't hear the audio clearly when vacuuming like I can with other cheap wired headphones
5964,2.0, The only reason I didn't return these for another brand is that they can be used one at a time unlike other brands
5965,2.0," Overall I'm disappointed with Apple, especially for the price"
5966,2.0, They would be totally worth it if they worked well and had different options for earbud styles
5967,5.0,I love AirPods
5968,5.0," If you have an iPhone, it’s one button to activate pairing and a simple tap on the screen"
5969,5.0," Not an audiophile sound quality, but still really good"
5970,5.0," I use them when I go running, they stay in my ear really well"
5971,5.0," A good measure would be if the wired EarPods stay in, you’re good"
5972,5.0," I can’t use ear buds that have the rubber tips, I have tried many kinds and they all hurt to keep in more than 10min"
5973,5.0," These are my solution to that, my runs can sometimes be an hour and a half, no problem"
5974,4.0,I purchased my first AirPods set in 2017 and was never impressed with their performance or battery life
5975,4.0, I only have one phone now
5976,4.0, iPhone 7
5977,4.0, No land line anymore
5978,4.0," And I use AirPods for practically all my personal and business calls, as I don't like to hold the phone next to my ear"
5979,4.0," AirPods (gen 1) used to lose connection to the iPhone during the calls, and usually would not last connected a full 1 hour conference call"
5980,4.0, I purchased this AirPods (gen 2) in Oct 2019 and time will tell if they hold the connection to the iPhone more reliably and the battery lasts longer
5981,4.0," Four stars for now, expecting them to be better than AirPods gen 1, but they still need to earn the fifth start"
5982,5.0,They are real 2nd generation
5983,5.0, I'm not sure why some people mentioned they got 1st gen
5984,5.0," For a moment I also thought they sent me the 1st gen, because I already have one pair of 2nd gen and the ones I already own have a green light outside on the case, and the airpods I got from this seller has the green light inside (you have to open the case to see it)"
5985,5.0," I realized that is because I had wireless charging case (light outside), while here I got the regular charging case (charging light inside)"
5986,5.0, I was not aware of that difference
5987,5.0, Best advice: before you comment you got 1st gen please check your serial number on Apple website to validate
5988,5.0, It will show you what model you got
5989,5.0," Besides that: they are the best pods, I wear them all the time, I even fall asleep with them and they're super comfortable"
5990,5.0," I am used to wearing only one, then whenever it dies, I just take another one, while the first one will charge"
5991,4.0,These do EXACTLY what they're supposed to do
5992,4.0," I'm a casual headphone user so I don't know what's considered ""good"" sound quality but these do the job if you're listening to music on your phone or whatever"
5993,4.0, I wouldn't say they're especially noise-cancelling but that's not really a priority for me
5994,4.0, I'm impressed with the battery life
5995,4.0," They last HOURS, which I didn't expect"
5996,4.0, Are they worth $130--well that's up to you
5997,4.0," I got these for $90 on sale, which was great"
5998,4.0," But if you want wireless earbuds that are guaranteed to work for everyday use, then I'd go for it"
5999,4.0, They also connect to your device pretty easily
6000,4.0, At first I thought you had to connect the headphones before you take them out of the charging pod but that was just my stupidity haha
6001,5.0,I purchased two sets of these
6002,5.0, One for my husband and one for myself to use for teaching online
6003,5.0," The AirPods are clear, the microphone pics up well"
6004,5.0, I've used it to help with amplification while doing live video and although it doesn't replace external auto mics it does help amplify my voice enough that people can hear me
6005,5.0,My husband had another microphone/earpiece to use for teaching his online classes and has told me over and over how much better the AirPods are
6006,4.0,"I was reluctant to join the bandwagon of Airpod users, but I'm happy I made the switch since my PowerBeats and Revjams both died out"
6007,4.0,"If you want noise cancelling, go for Revjams Active Pro"
6008,4.0, Could literally ride my back down the highway without the sound of cars destroying my music
6009,4.0," However, the Airpods have been absolutely excellent with the ease of connectivity with your bluetooth device, accessing Siri (can customize double-tap function on either airpod to access Siri, skip tracks, pause, etc), and charging"
6010,4.0," It seems like 15 minutes of charging them in the case gets them back up to 100%, which probably lasts about 3 hours of play time"
6011,4.0,"Overall, I'm really glad my wife got me these for my birthday Jan 2020"
6012,4.0, Would NOT go back to RevJams or BeatsPowerless
6013,4.0,I’ve wanted the AirPods for months so when I received these as a Christmas gift from my parents I was ecstatic
6014,4.0, It was fairly easy syncing the AirPods to my iPhone 7Plus via Bluetooth
6015,4.0," I tried both pods on right away, the sound quality was surprisingly great &’ they were pretty comfortable too"
6016,4.0, After a few hours (roughly 2) they started to get uncomfortable making my ear itch which then made me realize why I never used the headphones that originally came with the iPhone
6017,4.0, I had no idea Apple also has the AirPod Pros which look more comfortable so if you want comfort I’d highly recommend stop looking at these &’ head over to the AirPod Pros
6018,4.0, They also don’t allow you to go very far from your phone
6019,4.0," I had my phone sitting on the coffee table in my living room, I walked out front to take out the trash &’ the music started to get staticky going in & out"
6020,4.0,Only plus is being able to charge my phone &’ still listen to my music
6021,2.0,They worked well for about 15 months but then the left one failed
6022,2.0, I took them to the Apple store and was told they are just outside of warranty and repair would be $70
6023,2.0, Pretty disappointing
6024,2.0, I used them a lot for video conference calls— the ear piece batteries would last for about 3-hours in calls between charges
6025,2.0, Recharged very quickly in the case
6026,2.0,"Again, pretty decent but sucks they failed so soon"
6027,4.0,"Works great with all our Apple devices, nice and seamless connection"
6028,4.0,sometimes
6029,4.0, like anything they have issues and need to be reconnected as they dont do it automatically but when they do its really nice
6030,4.0, With aftermarket accessories the Airpods work great for just about any occasion
6031,4.0, I love then for work cause I can still hear just fine with my music low if someone needs to talk to me
6032,4.0, Battery in the case needs charging often with normal use which is not a huge deal but I find myself with dead earphone all to often as the case doesnt stay charged very long between uses
6033,5.0,"Sound quality is awesome, this is my second purchase, I had gotten one for my husband and now I got this one for me"
6034,5.0," My husband haves no complaints, me in the other hand, think that the headphones are a little loose sometimes and have to be fixing it so it doesn’t fall from my ear, but it’s not that bad, I love the clarity of my calls and music , it gets charged super fast"
6035,5.0, Very happy with my purchase
6036,4.0,I got caught up with the hype/trend of the airpods
6037,4.0, And there are good reason why it is popular
6038,4.0, The first thing is the convenience of quickly and easily pairing with your phone or even computer
6039,4.0," In terms of sound quality, the airpods doesn't sound at all different from the regular apple earpods"
6040,4.0, Essentially it is basically bluetooth earpods with the siri assistance built in
6041,4.0, (both look the same/same size and everything)
6042,4.0, There is hardly any noise cancellation since its not that kind of headphone
6043,4.0," The mic is okay but, I used it once and it sounds muddle when I tried it to record"
6044,4.0, One of the biggest plus using airpods is not having to deal with TANGLED WIRES
6045,4.0, The airpods have great battery life and it charges really quick
6046,4.0, I would say using airpods for around 4 hours leaves it around 70-80% on the airpods it self
6047,4.0," Last thing to mention is the price tag, yes it is expensive but, If you're someone who wants no bells or whistle and want a good reliable product, and is okay with the price tag then go with this"
6048,4.0, Yes there are other headphones that offer more features and maybe even cheaper price
6049,4.0," However, It is kind of hard to beat something this easy to use and part of the meme"
6050,4.0, So it is a great buy
6051,1.0,Checked the serial number on Apple’s website and it says these are legit
6052,1.0, But wonder if I got some counterfeits
6053,1.0, Why do people say these are so good
6054,1.0, The audio quality is horrible compared to the plug in airbuds that you get with your iPhone
6055,1.0, And the voice quality is abysmal
6056,1.0, I got these specifically for Zoom and Teams calls on my Mac book and people say they can barely hear me
6057,1.0, I make calls from my iPhone XS with these and the same issue
6058,1.0, I got on sale for $130 but that is till to much for these useless headphones
6059,1.0, Going back to the free plug in ear buds
6060,1.0," Also, they say 5 hours of battery life"
6061,1.0, But if you use for talk you only get 2 hours
6062,1.0, I am in meetings all day
6063,1.0, Useless
6064,5.0,This model of Airpods is the easiest to use
6065,5.0," I have an average ear, so they fit perfectly"
6066,5.0," I purchased the newer version, but missed the tap to answer feature, and had to go back to these"
6067,5.0, They switch seamlessly between my Apple products
6068,5.0,"If I lost them, I would purchase them again without any doubt"
6069,5.0," They’re amazing, reliable, and stay in your ears"
6070,5.0, The phone calls are very clear and bluetooth connects as soon as they touch your ear
6071,5.0, I can leave my phone downstairs while staying on a clear call upstairs
6072,5.0, I love it
6073,5.0,"Alright, I have to eat my words"
6074,5.0," I thought that I would never buy AirPods, and I thought that I would tolerate them, and i frowned on people with them"
6075,5.0, I love these
6076,5.0, They are so easy to use
6077,5.0," Pop them in your ear, the tone sounds and your call or music pops right over"
6078,5.0," The bluetooth connectivity is great, and the range is solid"
6079,5.0, I am super happy with the way that they stay in my ears
6080,5.0, In-Ear headphones were not an option for me
6081,5.0," I have tiny ears, and they either ache constantly or fall out"
6082,5.0, These do neither of those things
6083,5.0," Suck it up, buy them"
6084,5.0, And definitely buy them a little case with a carabiner
6085,5.0, They live on my car keys and I use them a ton
6086,3.0,The green light letting you know they have charged doesn't work
6087,3.0," They fit well in the ears, comfortable"
6088,3.0, The battery life of the case goes down quicker than the ear buds themselves
6089,3.0," But the battery life altogether didn’t last 1, 3-hour plane ride"
6090,3.0, Weird
6091,3.0," I need them now so no time to ship back, get new ones, blah blah…they are fine for now"
6092,3.0, I will purchase my next set directly from Apple so that I know they are authentic and will work correctly
6093,3.0, Good enough for now
6094,5.0,At first I wasn't a fan of wireless airpods
6095,5.0, I thought they were douchy and people walking around with them seemed to reflect that
6096,5.0, I am a true hard-wired headphone type of guy
6097,5.0," While I enjoy most Apple products, these are phenomenal"
6098,5.0, I am a true audiophile and the quality of sound is very good
6099,5.0," I saw these priced at the Apple Store for $199, but for a bit less on Amazon, they are worth the price"
6100,5.0, I added this to my arsenal of devices I carry and I don't mind to have yet another thing to charge and keep track of
6101,5.0, The AirPods also are very comfortable and emit a sound when you insert them into your ear
6102,5.0, The SIRI activation is also pleasant and nice
6103,5.0, Overall I recommend these for those who enjoy great sound quality and convenience
6104,3.0,I came into them all hyped
6105,3.0, Watched some reviews on YouTube but kept my hopes up
6106,3.0, The fit for my ears is mediocre at best
6107,3.0, Noise cancellation is nonexistent
6108,3.0, Charging case is a great feature
6109,3.0, It’s great for calls also
6110,3.0, Would NOT trust these in the gym at all
6111,3.0, They are not worth the price
6112,3.0, My Beats sound better but AirPods are more portable
6113,3.0, Guess my daughter is getting an early present
6114,3.0,**Edit**: Knocking off two stars due to concerns over long term reliability
6115,3.0, I've noticed they have issues connecting to my iPhone and the battery life seems to be shortening at a much faster rate than I anticipated
6116,3.0,"Like the title says, these earbuds are awesome"
6117,3.0,They integrate seamlessly with both my iPhone and Mac and I can easily switch between them with no loss in functionality
6118,3.0," As for sound quality, they do well in that department"
6119,3.0," They sound very similarly to the wired Apple earbuds, and along that same vain, they also fit like them too; if the regular Apple earbuds don't fit well, these won't be much different from that"
6120,3.0,"In all, these wireless earbuds are great"
6121,1.0,I received these headphones as a Christmas gift from a relative
6122,1.0, My first choice have not been Apple AirPods but Beats
6123,1.0," However, accepting a free gift is always fun"
6124,1.0, UNTIL you get fake Apple headphones from a third party vendor on Amazon
6125,1.0,"On the first connect, everything seemed fine"
6126,1.0, I sat them down for a second and went to use them again
6127,1.0, My phone started freezing and glitching
6128,1.0," When I attempted to turn my phone off bc my phone would not disconnect from them, I had an extremely hard time"
6129,1.0, I connected them to another device and they did the same thing
6130,1.0,I went into the Apple store here recently and discovered that the serial number on the box as listed in the photo have been reprinted on tons of Apple made boxes by the third party host using “true” Apple AirPods serial numbers
6131,1.0, They showed me the list
6132,1.0,This is highly disappointing and discrediting to Apple and also Amazon
6133,1.0,"If you purchase anything with a name brand on it especially Apple, please take your products to the main distributor to have them vip firm that you have made a legit purchase if you care about the quality of your product"
6134,1.0,"No, I will not be removing my review"
6135,1.0, Please handle this accordingly
6136,3.0,I was so happy with these until I got my first notification
6137,3.0, They almost blew out my eardrums
6138,3.0," Researched and found the only thing you can do about this is to toggle the ""change with buttons"" under ""sounds"" on the iPhone"
6139,3.0," This will take care of the problem UNLESS you change your volume in any other app and then it just reverts back to the ridiculously loud notifications (text, door camera, call, etc"
6140,3.0,) I need to decide if the convenience of using Siri with these things is worth my long-term hearing or if I should just send them back
6141,1.0,It will work for like a month but then one side stops working
6142,1.0," Before purchasing, I saw some other reviewers having the same issue but I hesitated to listen to them and went ahead with the purchase"
6143,1.0," Now, I’m realizing that I should’ve listened to them"
6144,1.0, I want to return it but get at least partial refund but that’s not possible before my return window has closed
6145,1.0, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this
6146,1.0," What’s really disturbing is that it’s an amazon choice, which makes it sounds like it’s the original and quality version of an apple product you’re buying but instead this piece of crap is nothing but disappointment and regrets"
6147,5.0,Sound better than I expected and very convenient
6148,5.0, My only complaint is that when I ordered it said I would get the latest version (AirPod 2 with H1 chip) and I received the first version AirPod
6149,5.0, This is not a big deal as there is apparently not much difference but I thought I would get the latest version
6150,5.0, Not worth going through the retuen process dealing with the Chatbot
6151,5.0,Update 4/5/2020 - Checked serial number and Apple says they are AirPod 2
6152,5.0, But it did come with the older wired charging case (I did order the wired charging case) which I don't see as a big deal although the LED on the exterior does seem a little better
6153,5.0, Happy with sound quality and microphone quality
6154,5.0, I'm upping my review to 5 stars
6155,5.0," Good quality product, good price, good delivery time"
6156,5.0, What's not to like
6157,1.0,These definitely belonged to someone before landing in my hands
6158,1.0, When I paired them it said “Rita’s AirPods
6159,1.0,” There was only two pieces of tape on the outside box and it was dirty
6160,1.0, The quality was terrible and the left headphone stopped working
6161,1.0, It’s things like this that really discourage me from ordering online
6162,1.0, 😞
6163,1.0,"Shameful, Amazon"
6164,1.0," This is an out right lie, these are not the latest AirPods, these are the original gen 1 AirPods"
6165,1.0, I’m a huge Apple fanboy and feel that I should have known better but didn’t notice where the charging light was until after I received them
6166,1.0," I bought these for my wife and was quickly embarrassed when the originals, rather than the gen 2 showed up"
6167,5.0,I didn’t know what I was missing
6168,5.0," I walk a couple of miles each morning and had been using corded earbuds, which I all too often would accidentally catch my hand on, or not have enough length to carry my phone in a pocket"
6169,5.0, These eliminated those issues
6170,5.0, I am also working remotely and have several ZOOM meetings a week
6171,5.0, I have started using the Air Pods for those as well
6172,5.0, They’re great for working in the yard without having to keep phone in hand or pocket
6173,5.0, Sound is very good
6174,5.0, Charge time is as advertised and recharge time is quick
6175,5.0,Like it so much
6176,5.0," I can absolutely say great quality, I did two times accidents laundry with it"
6177,5.0," After I pick them up from washer machine , I was afraid of dead AirPods"
6178,5.0, But they still work well and perfect sounds quality
6179,5.0," I use it every day during working or housework, never bother my ears, can hang on all day on my ears"
6180,5.0," You can see some satraches on my AirPods , you will see how often I use them"
6181,5.0," In short, great product from Apple, NO"
6182,5.0, 1 earphones
6183,5.0," Never disappoint, recommend it to people who wants earphones"
6184,5.0,These airpods are not just attractive but do exactly as they say: they allow you to get a clear sound while blocking out the outside noice
6185,5.0," My nephew wanted them, so I thought they were worth the investment"
6186,5.0,"The charging case is a nice touch, and they are easy to travel with"
6187,5.0, The added bonus for us was that they arrived almost a week earlier than expected
6188,5.0,Great quality and service
6189,5.0,How could anyone dislike Apple
6190,5.0,AirPods
6191,5.0," Talk about sound quality, it’s unbelievable"
6192,5.0, I just cannot get over the phenomenal quality of sound
6193,5.0, They come in a nice case and charger to plug into your usb outlet
6194,5.0, They charge in no time
6195,5.0, The AirPods are also smart
6196,5.0, Immediately connects to your phone through blue tooth
6197,5.0, You take one out and they immediately turn off but you still have the option to listen with one in the ear
6198,5.0, As soon as you open the cute little case they connect immediately to your phone
6199,5.0, Best Apple investment ever
6200,5.0,Been waiting and contemplating for a long time on whether to spend more than $100 on wireless AirPods
6201,5.0," After tripping on my headphone cable and having my phone almost fall into a creek, I decided to take the leap"
6202,5.0, DEFINITELY WORTH EVERY DIME
6203,5.0, Battery life is incredible
6204,5.0, Even more incredible is the time the AirPods take to recharge once you put them to charge in the charged case
6205,5.0, Holy super speed charging
6206,5.0, It literally feels like it takes less than 2 to 3 minutes to charge them from 10% to 100%
6207,5.0, Best product I have purchased on Amazon so far
6208,5.0," Also, I would highly recommend buying a case for your AirPods as soon as you get them"
6209,5.0, I chose the cartoon looking deadpool and I couldn’t be happier
6210,2.0,Arrrrrgh
6211,2.0," After a long time putting off this purchase because I was unsure whether they would pair well with my Galaxy phone, I finally relented"
6212,2.0, Only to be disappointed
6213,2.0,The Bluetooth pairing often drops or is sketchy
6214,2.0," When that happens, I have to carry my phone close to my ears to catch the signal"
6215,2.0," Which, essentially, eliminates the need for the earbuds"
6216,2.0,"When I went to return them, Amazon offered tech support"
6217,2.0, Which was great because it fixed the problem
6218,2.0, for about 2 days
6219,2.0," But by the time I got back around to returning them, the window had closed"
6220,2.0,Very disappointed that I'm now stuck with a lightly used product I can't return
6221,5.0,I only put one star on noise cancellation since these are more for like sound awareness
6222,5.0, I like it because you can hear things around you but music quality is still good
6223,5.0, Sometimes I even think my phone is playing the music and not the actual headphones
6224,5.0, Gift for my brother
6225,5.0, Works with non apple products as well
6226,4.0,These air pods have surprisingly good battery life and are really comfortable to wear
6227,4.0, I primarily use my air pods during work
6228,4.0, So probably 5-8 hours a work day
6229,4.0, I use them intermittently due to having to interact with my coworkers
6230,4.0, I charge them every time I have to give someone my attention
6231,4.0, As a result of that I've never ran out of battery life in a single day
6232,4.0," I also find them extremely comfortable, like I forget they are even there sometimes if I paused my audiobook"
6233,4.0," While I don't exercise with them, I haven't had one fall out yet during regular use"
6234,4.0, But I am cautious enough to not use them around water as I fear they might fall out and be damaged in such circumstances
6235,4.0,"Unfortunately, we are only allowed one earbud in while we work"
6236,4.0, Some areas of my workspace are loud due primarily to large AC units and conveyors converging in certain areas
6237,4.0," Due to this, I do have one complaint about them"
6238,4.0, They don't cancel noise very well
6239,4.0," I used to have another pair of wireless ear buds and they were much better at cancelling out sound, even with one ear free"
6240,4.0, As a result I am frequently having to pause my audiobook in these areas as I don't want to blow out one of my eardrums trying to overpower the external sounds with raising the volume of my device
6241,4.0,"As to regards about sound quality, I find them good for my purposes"
6242,4.0, Listening to podcasts and audiobooks in standard quality
6243,4.0," I have decent headphones at home if I want an audiophile experience with high quality audio formats especially with music, games, and shows"
6244,4.0, But the air pods don't necessarily sound terrible
6245,4.0, They are just a little annoying to pair between my iphone and pc back and forth
6246,4.0," (Not a fan of Macs, sorry apple crowd)"
6247,4.0,"As I only use them while I work, I don't take calls, so I can't comment on the sound receiving end of the earbuds and their use as a headset"
6248,4.0,Overall I think they are pretty great product
6249,4.0," I did receive the newest model, it was factory sealed and did not appear to have been used"
6250,4.0, I read a couple of bad reviews and I was particularly worried about receiving a previous model or returned item sold as new
6251,4.0, Thankfully everything was fine
6252,5.0,They charge super fast
6253,5.0, They last for about 4 hours if on consistently
6254,5.0," If you have braids or any type of heavy hair, be careful because it will try to knock them out of your ears"
6255,5.0, The sound is weird sometimes
6256,5.0, It will sound clogged up or it will make it sound more digital
6257,5.0, This only happened to me when I opened certain apps
6258,5.0, Apps that have ads or music in the background already
6259,5.0, The AirPods have trouble processing that I suppose
6260,5.0, Over all they connect super easy to your phone like barely any set up
6261,5.0, I would say to beware of connecting the AirPods to another device that’s not apple
6262,5.0, It works but it is difficult to connect them back to your iPhone after you do that
6263,5.0, I had to google it
6264,5.0, That’s what the small button is for on it
6265,5.0, Other than that I think it’s worth the purchase
6266,5.0,"I held off on the airpods because they just looked strange, not to mention how people looked wearing them and I worried they would fall out and I would lose one but those concerns haven't really happened"
6267,5.0," They fit well, the sound quality is great and you adjust really quick"
6268,5.0, I also like the solid-ness of them and their case
6269,5.0, They don't feel flimsy like some I have seen which isn't a surprise with Apple quality
6270,5.0, I ended up getting second pair for gift for sister and she loves them too
6271,5.0, Good investment and I LOVE not dealing with headphone wires
6272,5.0,These work great
6273,5.0, No static like other brands I've tried
6274,5.0, And people can actually hear me clearly on phone calls
6275,5.0,"The distance was amazing at first, but after about a week it started breaking up if I was more than 30 feet from the phone"
6276,5.0, Good enough
6277,5.0, It's held charge well
6278,5.0, I have an Android phone and it connects well
6279,5.0, It changes between my phone and computer decently also
6280,5.0," Oh, they're also comfortable"
6281,5.0, My other pair would hurt my ear
6282,5.0, These don't
6283,5.0, I've only used them for calls and the computer
6284,5.0, I haven't tried running with them
6285,5.0, They stay in my ear and don't move around and don't hurt
6286,5.0,My wife listens to or reads books constantly when she’s not sewing a quilt or taking care of the grand-babies
6287,5.0, She had an off-brand Bluetooth set of air buds but couldn’t get them to pair with each other
6288,5.0, Both would pair separately with her iPhone but not both
6289,5.0, She took these out of the charging container and like magic they paired instantly with each other and to her phone
6290,5.0, Wow
6291,5.0, What a difference buying original Apple air pods made
6292,5.0, No comparison at all
6293,5.0, Thanks Apple
6294,1.0,These AirPods were great
6295,1.0, until they weren't
6296,1.0, I have been using them just fine and about a week ago out of nowhere they just stopped connecting to my iPhone
6297,1.0, I'll get a connection maybe once every 5 tries and even then I get a weird tinny sound with no bass and then have to try to reconnect again and again
6298,1.0," Of course, the return window has closed"
6299,1.0, Really disappointed and don't know what to do with them now
6300,5.0,I actually really like these headphones for the ease of being able to multi task w/o a cord always attached
6301,5.0, Going to the gym and doing intense workouts with minimal adjusting in between
6302,5.0, My only complaint is that battery life
6303,5.0," As an write this review at 10:15 am, batteries previously charged to 100%, only using to answer calls, my ear buds currently sit at 54%"
6304,5.0," You’d think with these being the hottest buds on the market, the battery life would be impeccable"
6305,5.0," Slightly disappointed in that, overall pleased"
6306,5.0,Update: just realized their used
6307,5.0,I bought these to replace my Jaybird Freedoms and thought I'd be trading sound quality for convivence and was willing to settle for that
6308,5.0," I assumed these would be easy to set up, would turn on and off seamlessly and give me great features, and I assumed they would sound sub par compared to the Jaybirds"
6309,5.0, I was right on two of those assumptions
6310,5.0, The sound quality is in fact on par with Jaybirds
6311,5.0," If I have to nitpick they aren't as comfortable as the Jaybirds, but that's not saying they are uncomfortable"
6312,5.0,At first I wasn't sure if I should order since some reviewers claimed to get fake AirPods
6313,5.0, I went ahead an ordered them a day ago and got them in the mail today
6314,5.0, So far I am enjoying them
6315,5.0, The package was still wrapped properly when I received it
6316,5.0, I went ahead and checked the serial number on the AirPod box on the Apple website and it came back as authentic 2nd generation AirPods
6317,5.0," A lot of other people stated they got used AirPods, mine came wrapped properly in the plastic just like they where at the apple store and had all the proper instructions and charger"
6318,5.0, No sign of being used
6319,5.0," I would say if you are considering them they are a great deal, considering you will save $30 buying here vs the apple store"
6320,5.0,I debated getting a pair of these as I thought I was content with the pair of earbuds that come with the phone but I’m super glad I purchased these
6321,5.0, First of all I feel like these were a wonderful price compared to apple and even as a refurbished product these are amazing
6322,5.0, The sound quality is amazing and I love not having a cord dangling around having to deal with
6323,5.0, They easily pair with apple devices and thought I haven’t tried pairing with a non apple Bluetooth device it’s supposed to be easy as well
6324,5.0, There’s a button the case you press to pair with a non apple Bluetooth device which is convenient
6325,5.0, The battery life blows me away
6326,5.0, They constantly Stay charged in the case and I have only had to charge the case a couple times in the few months I’ve had these
6327,5.0, Very convenient and definitely worth purchasing if you’re on the fence
6328,1.0,"These disconnect frequently, normally just the left one"
6329,1.0," I have tried everything from disconnecting and reconnecting, turning off ear detect, disconnecting all other Bluetooth devices, and many more"
6330,1.0, nothing helps
6331,1.0, These are the worst headphones I’ve ever had the displeasure of purchasing
6332,1.0,"And to ad, they’re EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE, do yourself a favor and get a better brand that isn’t overpriced"
6333,5.0,1
6334,5.0,) Having owned both of them (i
6335,5.0,e
6336,5.0," apple AirPods vs galaxy buds, not the pro versions of both ), I can say that the noise cancellation is better in galaxy buds but the quality of the sound from AirPods is out of the world"
6337,5.0,2
6338,5.0,") Charging is better in AirPods vs galaxy buds, I use it for like 10 mins at a time and it lasts for a day if not less"
6339,5.0,3
6340,5.0,") Taking off one star because you can still hear noises after wearing this, if you want total cancellation upgrade to the pro version"
6341,5.0,4
6342,5.0,") Personally, I don't find much use in using a wireless charging one compared to a wired one"
6343,3.0,"I don’t know if I received counterfeit AirPods or if Apple has cut the quality of the product in the last couple years, but the product I received is very inferior to the 2017 models I replaced"
6344,3.0," The case is lighter; the lid feels light and flimsy, as if it could be twisted off"
6345,3.0," The pods themselves feel and sound identical to the old ones, but these cut out frequently"
6346,3.0, Or just the left one will cut and the right one continues on
6347,5.0,This is a wonderful product that I am very impressed with
6348,5.0," I usually HATE Apple, but"
6349,5.0,*Connects flawlessly to my iPhone
6350,5.0, Bat life seems decent
6351,5.0,*Sound quality is great (more than just great)
6352,5.0,*Works beautifully with the Pandora app
6353,5.0,*will take calls seamlessly and resume music afterward
6354,5.0,*The earbuds fit & stay in well enough to go rucking for several hours
6355,5.0,*Feels like a quality product that was well made and thought out
6356,5.0,I initially hated the shift Apple made when it removed headphone jacks
6357,5.0," I have to say, after finally making the shift due to the price drop to ~$120, I bought 2 pair for my wife and I"
6358,5.0," We love them, we use them all the time and can't recommend them highly enough"
6359,5.0,My wife jams to the tunes during the day
6360,5.0," I keep one in my ear while teleworking for conference calls made easy, and shift to the other airpod when the first one gets low battery"
6361,5.0," Very seamless, and the sound quality is phenomenal - microphone included"
6362,3.0,Waited a good 5 day’s to write a review as I wanted to give them an honest chance
6363,3.0, After being told these are the best and researching a good month
6364,3.0, I will say the sound quality isn’t bad
6365,3.0, It’s not the best I’ve heard but for wireless headphones there’s not a static in the background like some of the cheaper models
6366,3.0, The double tap feature is a little strange as it takes a bit to find that perfect spot
6367,3.0, Also it’s double tap being pause and fast forward I haven’t been able to ge the music to skip forward only pause
6368,3.0, So that feature I haven’t used all that much
6369,3.0, They do slip a bit in your ears so I recommend buying the ear hooks
6370,3.0, I bought them and they work pretty well with them
6371,3.0, There’s also silicon options for covers to help the slipping
6372,3.0, I’d also recommend a case for the charging case as it’s quite small and kinda slippery
6373,3.0, So all in all I think they’re a decent pair of headphones
6374,3.0, Just don’t go into the purchase expecting perfection
6375,3.0,"I like these headphones because of the convenience it provides, especially around the house"
6376,3.0, It makes cooking while watching videos on my phone super easy
6377,3.0, I love making important calls using my AirPods
6378,3.0," The only thing that I don’t like is that when I am on the train during my commute, you can’t hear clearly even if the volume is loud (which can damage your ears)"
6379,3.0," So if this is going to be a huge investment for you and sound quality is important, I would say get some beats or other better headphones"
6380,3.0, I can’t listen to podcasts on the train because you hear the train over the audio
6381,1.0,"Quite simply the product worked for 5 minutes with only one paired AirPod, went trough all the trouble shooting to reset and sync them again even got a replacement pod to no avail"
6382,1.0, So it is after trying every step to fix it that I write this review
6383,1.0," They suck, they’re unreliable and finicky at best"
6384,1.0," Yeah the sound quality is great IF they work, I’m bummed at all the high reviews for these because they’re made cheaply and without care or concern for the product"
6385,1.0, I shouldn’t spend top dollar on a top dollar device for it to act like dollar store headphones
6386,1.0, I’m dissatisfied and disappointed at the terrible quality of this worthless product
6387,4.0,I've bought 3 pairs now
6388,4.0, The first two were eaten by the dog at different points in time and therefore needed to be replaced
6389,4.0," The sound quality is decent, but I don't have anything to compare it to"
6390,4.0, Each pair has had it's own type of glitchy-ness
6391,4.0, The latest pair cuts in and out for no discernible reason
6392,4.0," But, reasonably priced considering my dog will likely chew thru them again in the future"
6393,3.0,I love my airpods and have been using them for some time now
6394,3.0, I've never had an issue until recently where one airpod never seems to charge in the case despite the case being fully charged
6395,3.0, I don't know why this happened all of a sudden this past month
6396,3.0, Its incredibly frustrating when I put them in and one seems to have charged perfectly and the other one is at 0%
6397,3.0, Has anyone else encountered this problem
6398,3.0," Other than that, theyve worked great for the past year"
6399,3.0,I bought these I thought as an alternative to more expensive Apple AirPods and was I wrong
6400,3.0, I used them solely with my IPad and the sound bounces periodically from one ear to the other losing sound in the other ear
6401,3.0, This is an occasional occurrence but annoying enough to be unhappy
6402,3.0, When I first tried using them with my Android phone they wouldn’t stay connected and I had to carry my case with me
6403,3.0, I don’t recommend buying these
6404,3.0, I purchased a warranty with them and my first contact with CS was not fruitful
6405,3.0, I will update my review shortly
6406,5.0,Christmas gift for my daughter- was exactly what she wanted
6407,5.0, Opened the case cover and immediately her phone asked to pair with these
6408,5.0, Installation could not be any easier
6409,5.0, Love that these are genuine Apple products as I can be sure that they will work correctly with the other Apple products that we already own and use daily
6410,5.0," I have always found Apple quality and engineering to be exceptional, and service when having an issue to be top-notch"
6411,5.0, These were a great value
6412,1.0,I love the product and used it regularly
6413,1.0," it worked perfectly, however after 3 months I noticed one day that it kept connecting and disconnecting"
6414,1.0," When it finally worked, music played in only the right airpod"
6415,1.0," I troubleshooted the issue and reset the airpods, forgot the device and even resetted my phone"
6416,1.0, It wasn’t an issue with my phone but for some reason the device wasn’t even showing up in Bluetooth devices
6417,1.0," I called apple support and they told me to do the same thing I did, in fact there was nothing they could do for me to fix it"
6418,1.0, It doesn’t connect to any other iphone and would not appear in non apple phones
6419,1.0, Do not buy this product without knowing there could be risks
6420,1.0," If you happen to have a faulty airpod, even with a warranty, you wont be able to use it ever again"
6421,1.0, I dont even know what to do with mine
6422,1.0, There no physical damage so I dont understand the problem
6423,1.0," Please be aware that if your airpods have internal errors, you"
6424,1.0, Are
6425,1.0, Screwed
6426,1.0,I am so upset with this purchase
6427,1.0, I bought them thinking it was a great deal so something that was in fair condition
6428,1.0, When I received the headphones I didn’t open them right away as I was busy planning my daughters birthday
6429,1.0, When I finally opened them the airpods wouldn’t connect to my phone for some reason
6430,1.0, After extensive research as to why they were f charging or connecting I found out that the AirPods inside the case were switched out and the AirPods were fake which is why I wasn’t holding any charge or connecting to my phone
6431,1.0, I was so upset because I lost my money given that the window for return passed and was given an fauly product
6432,1.0, Be careful when ordering these headphones and check them as soon as you buy them so you are able to return if needed
6433,1.0, So upsetting to received a fake product
6434,1.0, Amazon should really check for authenticity upon product returns like this
6435,5.0,"Like this so much , got it from black sale for saving 30 bucks"
6436,5.0," After a simple a tap setup,it’s automatically connected with my iPhone and always on"
6437,5.0," Anytime when I am on the phone, just easy to put it on one of my ears, it connected immediately , high quality sounds , 2 moods to switch and less noise "
6438,5.0, It’s fast charging and can be wireless charging
6439,5.0," When I busy and battery was out, I got it charged for 15 mins and it can last 3 hours to use"
6440,5.0,Recommend these hand free and high quality sounds AirPods 
6441,1.0,DO NOT BUY
6442,1.0,They won’t stay in your ear
6443,1.0,Quality of sound and battery life is good
6444,1.0, Great when I am just sitting down
6445,1.0, TERRIBLE if you WALK
6446,1.0,"I wore one in my left ear, sitting in the hospital waiting room"
6447,1.0," After my husband’s surgery, I went to get the car; it had fallen out and I couldn’t find it"
6448,1.0, Less than 2 months old
6449,1.0," Still in the 90 day warranty, but I couldn’t return them, because one was missing"
6450,5.0,I was a skeptic for so long but the slim profile and ease of use without chords I will never go back to wires
6451,5.0, They pair instantly if you’re lazy like me that’s awesome and I can’t really speak to quality
6452,5.0, They aren’t going to vibrate your ears with the bass but for podcasts and your average music listener they are perfect
6453,5.0, Anyone who is on the phone for work a lot will love these as well
6454,5.0, Very fast charging as well
6455,5.0, I went from skeptic to advocate for these guys
6456,5.0, They are quite expensive so I would only recommend if you use Bluetooth headphones heavily already
6457,5.0,I’m pretty pleased with these AirPods
6458,5.0, I wasn’t expecting greatness I just wanted to be able to listen to music while I charged my phone
6459,5.0, It works great for what I need it too
6460,5.0, It doesn’t work well with non Apple products though so don’t get these if you want to use them for that
6461,5.0, At first I had trouble with the right air pod losing battery quicker and disconnecting while in use but that problem went away pretty quick
6462,5.0, I like them a lot but it really is just headphones without cords so don’t expect much more
6463,3.0,"I’m not going to lie, I was worried they wouldn’t stay in my ear as well- but Working in the medical field, I don’t have any issues with them falling out"
6464,3.0," They can have some difficulties with adjusting to just one headphone taken out and listening in the other still, as the headphones think you’re putting them away and you have to reconnect the Bluetooth"
6465,3.0," Overall though they work great, I can answer phone calls while doing dishes, or talk on the phone while driving and have no worries about accidents"
6466,1.0,I purchased the apple ear pods 32 days ago for my husbands birthday and they don't work
6467,1.0, So I contacted amazon to return them
6468,1.0, They told me a couldn't because it expired 2 days ago
6469,1.0, I told them I couldn't return them during the pandemic and they told me they would NOT make an acceptation
6470,1.0," How can I return and item when the WORLD is closed because of a pandemic, seriously"
6471,1.0, This is crap I deserve my money back
6472,1.0, I asked for a supervisor and they told me they were busy
6473,3.0,"I liked the sound quality and noise cancellation on this product but as for the battery life on this Air Pods even if it’s an Apple Product, it’s not exactly great what I hoped"
6474,3.0, I should’ve done extensive research before purchasing an second generation Apple Air Pods especially online but I decided just to keep them
6475,3.0, I only use them at home whenever I’m listening to my music on my iPhone or use them when I’m talking with my therapist on the phone
6476,5.0,This is great here’s the run down:
6477,5.0,Earbuds last about 4-5 hours nonstop use
6478,5.0, Takes about 30min for at least 50-60% charge in the case
6479,5.0, The case itself last for days before u need a charge
6480,5.0, I think I went a week
6481,5.0, Mind you I work 5 days a week 8hours
6482,5.0, Sitting at a desk in front of a computer
6483,5.0, I have the time to use it lol
6484,5.0, Calls are amazing great sound
6485,5.0, I have had no issues running with them everyone’s ears are different so if u run and u don’t use the regular iPhone headphones then this is not for u or you may have to get the ear grips
6486,5.0, But if your looking for a good wireless headset and willing to spend some cash get these
6487,5.0,Best part about the air pods is that you can wear them and there aren’t any wires to get caught on anything
6488,5.0," Also, you can wear them and walk around the house without holding onto your phone or iPad"
6489,5.0," Finally, the storage is so compact and convenient"
6490,5.0, So easy to put in your pocket or purse and no tangles when you take them out of the pocket or purse
6491,5.0, My son bought them for me for my birthday and I liked it so much I bought them for 2 of my grandchildren
6492,1.0,Very disappointed
6493,1.0, Left earbud quit working 7 days after return date
6494,1.0, I contacted the seller
6495,1.0, Third party and they transferred me to Apple
6496,1.0, After 2 hours on the phone with Apple we now need to schedule an appointment to have them looked at 45 miles away
6497,1.0, This is not good costumer service at all
6498,1.0," We tried to save a little money on Amazon with this purchase, I guess we should have just got them at an Apple Store"
6499,5.0,I had bought a case for them and they fit just PERFECTLY the sound is great and so far i haven’t had any problem
6500,5.0,", you should buy it"
6501,5.0,***update***
6502,5.0,My airpods are still working PERFECTLY and I bought one for my boyfriend and they are original as well and my boyfriend loves them
6503,5.0,Excelente audífonos
6504,5.0,", son originales y traen garantía desde Apple no he tenido problemas algunos funcionan bien con mi iPhone y iPad"
6505,5.0,"Expected more out of sound quality, gave as a gift and the comments were and I agree, they are blue tooth and no Bose (they were grateful for the gift"
6506,5.0,)
6507,5.0, I can also hear what they are listening to more than I did with the corded ear buds
6508,5.0,Cool features that when you take a bud out it pauses your music so you can listen to what someone is saying
6509,5.0, Two people can listen without being connected by a corded earbud
6510,5.0, And you can leave one bud in the charging case and listen with the other
6511,5.0,These earpods are very good quality
6512,5.0, I purchased them as a gift and they are everything expected
6513,5.0, They have great Bluetooth range
6514,5.0, Can pair them to a cellphone and use from another room
6515,5.0," Although the microphone could be a little stronger, the sound quality is great"
6516,5.0, I definitely recommend these
6517,5.0, I do feel that the price is high
6518,5.0," You can find other earbuds cheaper, at least you know these will last and they are good quality"
6519,5.0,I am an Android user and NEVER considered these since I thought they only worked with Apple phone
6520,5.0," Dumb, I know"
6521,5.0, I tried 3 different headphones and 1 pair of earbuds (Amazon
6522,5.0,horrible) and I was still unsatisfied
6523,5.0, My kids use the Airpods and I tried them on my Galaxy S9
6524,5.0, WOW
6525,5.0," PERFECT, Easy to pair, comfortable, great sound, great battery and I can wear them all day and switch between music and phone calls"
6526,5.0," Recenlty upgraded to the Samsung S21 Ultra and I think, if possible, the sound is even better"
6527,4.0,The only reason I gave in and bought air pods was because I was having issues connecting my Apple devices to other brands
6528,4.0, These are hassle free changing between devices
6529,4.0, On the downside they are very uncomfortable on the ear took me 2 months to get use to them
6530,4.0, Currently having issues with left air pod sometimes won’t connect
6531,4.0, Battery life is ok I’ve had cheap ones that last way better
6532,5.0,Apple headphones are the only headphones that fit my ears well and stay put
6533,5.0," I run marathons and have used the corded version, but recently switched to these AirPods"
6534,5.0," Wow, they are awesome"
6535,5.0, No cord to get tangled on my clothing or messing around with plugging stuff in at the starting line
6536,5.0, I wish I had purchased these sooner
6537,5.0,"As for battery life, these are new and last me through 5 hours of running"
6538,5.0," The charging case battery last longer than I had expected (2 weeks on average, but I’m not draining the headphones every time I wear them)"
6539,4.0,like all apple products they are so well made and well packaged
6540,4.0," I opened them and thought, wow what a cool case"
6541,4.0, They paired easier than any bluetooth I have ever used
6542,4.0, Sound quality is excellent
6543,4.0, I can finally disconnect from my phone and listen to my youtube playlist and easily accept incoming calls midstream
6544,4.0, I am not sure I understand them fully yet - how to adjust volume
6545,4.0, Not sure
6546,4.0, I made a call through SIRI
6547,4.0, Lovely product at the discounted primeday price
6548,4.0, I don't think I would pay full price for them though
6549,5.0,I am a musician and as such have used a variety of headphones and earbuds
6550,5.0," For recording you want a flat response but for pleasure, you want a slightly sweetened sound"
6551,5.0, I have two pair of Bose earbuds that I really like but I was shocked at how good these AirPods sounded
6552,5.0, I heard instruments I’d not heard before
6553,5.0, Better stereo separation and great deep but articulated bass
6554,5.0,"And they run for hours, handle voice commands perfectly and are great in my office for phone work"
6555,5.0, And they literally recharge to 100% in 15 minutes
6556,5.0,These are the best sonic and overall earbuds I’ve ever owned
6557,1.0,Amazon publicly states in their website that these airpods are BRAND NEW
6558,1.0," When I received mine and paired it with my iPhone, I discovered that ""Daniel's Airpod"" now showed up in my iPhone's Bluetooth settings"
6559,1.0," Obviously, Daniel previously bought this set of airpods and named his bluetooth connection"
6560,1.0," So much for brand new, unopened product"
6561,1.0, I had so much trouble figuring out how to use the product because the product documentation was so small I had to use a magnifying glass too read it
6562,1.0, And the documentation didn't make sense
6563,1.0," One side of this really small, folded piece of paper was in English, the other side was Chinese"
6564,1.0," One section had numbered instructions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6"
6565,1.0, Yes
6566,1.0, They skipped #5
6567,1.0, That is a real Apple product
6568,1.0,I ended up returning this product to Amazon and ordering earpods directly from Apple
6569,1.0, What a difference between this and Amazon's product
6570,1.0,Do NOT buy this
6571,5.0,These were cheaper to order on Amazon then ordering from Apple
6572,5.0, My daughter loves these and the fact that you can use only one at a time as well
6573,5.0, The fact that she has long hair you cant even tell she is wearing them at all
6574,5.0, She can bring up Siri and talk on the phone all without having to even touch her phone
6575,5.0,If you are leaning towards getting these then DO IT
6576,5.0, I was hesitant because of how expensive a pair of wireless headphones are
6577,5.0," What made me cave was ordering a ""highly reviewed"" set of knock off ones that were just horrible and couldnt connect to each other and when they finally did one kept cutting out"
6578,5.0, So I decided to get the real ones
6579,5.0, I was seeing great reviews so I bought them and then it offered me Apple Care+ which I did purchase
6580,5.0, Thats when I was getting really nervous because I was seeing all the bad reviews of people getting used ones and scratched ones
6581,5.0," I even seen a review where someone said they couldn't connect them and only one worked, which was what I was afraid of"
6582,5.0, Well I looked on my amazon order after it had shipped and it gave me a serial number
6583,5.0, I checked it with apple and it was indeed an apple product
6584,5.0, Still a little worried at that point
6585,5.0, I got home that day and opened the amazon box and was very happy that it was in a sealed package and very brand new
6586,5.0, I was very hopeful since I bought the Apple Care+ there was no way it wasn't legit
6587,5.0, I opened the package and flipped the lid open and they connected to my phone within less than 5 seconds and I was on my way
6588,5.0, I din't have to charge them at all and they lasted all night til I went to bed
6589,5.0, They cancel outside noises out the louder they are
6590,5.0, They are very comfortable
6591,5.0, The sound quality is amazing
6592,5.0, You hear certain songs a little differently(in a better way)
6593,5.0, You hear parts of the song that weren't all that clear before
6594,5.0, Its hard to explain what I mean and you'd have to get them to understand
6595,5.0, I was never one to really like Apple
6596,5.0," But now I have an iPhone XR, an iPad and now Airpods and I am so happy that I caved in and bought them"
6597,5.0, If I could give 10 stars I would
6598,5.0, GET THESE AIRPODS
6599,5.0, And just make sure you are buying from Apple and not a third party
6600,5.0, If they offer you an Apple Care+ then it is legit from Apple
6601,5.0, Sorry for the long review but you guys have to know
6602,5.0,Best Christmas gift
6603,5.0," Long battery life, great sound on songs and videos but also calls"
6604,5.0, Love that it pauses my video if it falls out of your ear
6605,5.0, My daughter so very happy
6606,5.0," We’ve owned a few from random Brands from China, which were surprisingly good don’t get me wrong lol but there’s an immediate difference in all ways"
6607,5.0,Headphones are great and make chores and gym easier as I don’t get the wire snagged like my other headphones in random things
6608,5.0, Battery life is awesome and I’m between uses the charger case makes quick work of charging
6609,5.0," I was concerned about running out of batteries because I will have heavy use occasionally, but the case charges the pods quick and the case charges fully in like 10 minutes with them inside"
6610,5.0," GREAT buy, especially with Prime Day prices"
6611,5.0, Only issue is they don’t seem to cancel as much noise
6612,5.0, Maybe because of some of the tech lime automatically pausing when one comes out kinda thing
6613,5.0, Who knows
6614,5.0, Also when you get sweaty you have to pay more attention because they slide a little easier but overall an amazing upgrade to my wired ones
6615,4.0,Bought in March for my birthday
6616,4.0, I was very excited and happy the first few months
6617,4.0, Last two months I noticed that the battery ran very short
6618,4.0, As matter of fact I use it much less these days and wonder if it’s genuine APPLE product
6619,4.0, Very disappointed as for now
6620,4.0," Back in summer I spent lot of time in gardening, listening to music and podcast"
6621,4.0, Now I only use for few phone calls
6622,4.0, I would like the seller to contact me to see if a replacement can be granted
6623,4.0, Otherwise I’ll need a new one
6624,4.0,Thank you for listening
6625,4.0,Good sound quality
6626,4.0, I can just tap on it to play it but I haven't found a way how to pause it using just a tap
6627,4.0, My previous ear-bud gave me difficulty while using it for call and conversations
6628,4.0, This one I like it much as no echo issue and able to hear each other quite well with good quality as well
6629,4.0," Not all ear-buds fits well in my ear, but and this one too doesn't fit very well for long time, but for short duration it fits well"
6630,4.0," I am sure the issue must be with my ear, and nothing wrong with this product"
6631,4.0, It is a good quality ear-bud
6632,1.0,FRAUD
6633,1.0, I received one Apple AirPod (left ear) and an off brand (right ear)
6634,1.0, I knew something wasn’t right when it kept disconnecting from Bluetooth
6635,1.0, I usually wear one pod at a time but I put them both in my ear at the same time and noticed that one was longer than the other
6636,1.0, See the picture for example
6637,1.0," If you’re going to sell off brand headsets, don’t attach the name Apple AirPods to it, to make it seem like it’s legitimate because it’s not"
6638,1.0, I will never purchase from this seller again
6639,5.0,"I didn't want to ""pay the price"" for authentic airpods and I tried off brands and other types but none are as good as the real thing"
6640,5.0," I like these better than the 3rd generation because I don't like the ""squishy"" noise cancellation ear piece because I like to be able to hear alittle bit while I am walking (like cars and dogs approaching)"
6641,5.0, These sound good and the batteries last a long time
6642,5.0, Glad I finally bit the bullet and got another pair after losing my first one
6643,1.0,These WERE amazing
6644,1.0, Then out of no where the left microphone stopped working and no one could hear me
6645,1.0, Then a few months later the right microphone stopped working and I couldn’t use them to talk to anyone but I could still listen to music
6646,1.0, NOW both have completely stopped working and I can’t use them to talk on the phone and I can’t even listen to music on them anymore
6647,1.0, ABSOLUTE garbage for 150 bucks
6648,1.0, Buyer beware and look elsewhere
6649,5.0,"I always told myself I wouldn't get these because they looked so stupid, but I broke down one day and tried them out"
6650,5.0,now I'll never go back
6651,5.0, They are so easy to connect
6652,5.0, I was worried they would fall out of my ear easily but they don't
6653,5.0, Great to use when you are at the gym or need to have your hands free without a cord in your way
6654,5.0, You can change the settings on the double tap feature for each ear
6655,5.0, I wish there were more options (like a triple tap or something else)
6656,5.0,"most of the time I only have one in so I am limited in what I can do without picking up my phone, but this is a very minor inconvenience"
6657,1.0,"If you have any problems, Apple will walk you through troubleshooting steps, then send you to Apple"
6658,1.0, Apple fixed but then issued reoccurred and now out of Amazon’s return timeframe
6659,1.0," Now having to go back to Apple, but they won’t refund"
6660,1.0, Just keep having to get issue repaired again until warranty runs out
6661,1.0," I love AirPods, but there is virtually no way to get a refund for a defective set, it seems"
6662,1.0, skip the hassle and purchase them directly from Apple
6663,1.0,Do not buy these
6664,1.0, I am not sure if it is because new airpods are out or if this is not through apple directly
6665,1.0," My AirPods constantly fail to connect, and at least once a week i will leave both in the charging case only to have one of them be dead when i wake up"
6666,1.0, Absolutely horrible product and doesnt work more often than it does
6667,1.0, Please do not waste your money like I did
6668,4.0,I have very small ears apparently
6669,4.0, I have spent 100's of dollars trying to find a pair of headphones that work for me
6670,4.0, these are still not them
6671,4.0, If you have small ear holes these will fall out constantly
6672,4.0," So, I honestly hate using these so much"
6673,4.0," BUT, with all that being said, they are VERY comfortable"
6674,4.0, they do not hurt my ears at
6675,4.0," again small ear holes, a lot of headphones start hurting within 30 minutes of wearing them"
6676,4.0, The sound is REALLY good
6677,4.0, The convenience is the only reason I didn't return them
6678,4.0, The battery life lasts FOREVER
6679,4.0, I think I have charged them three times since I got them * I don't use them everyday*
6680,4.0, They connect really easily too
6681,4.0, If you have small ears hard pass but if you have normal ears then these are for you
6682,4.0, The best way to know if they will fit and stay in is to wear the ones the phone came with
6683,4.0, exactly the same fit without the mess of a cord
6684,2.0,Very Disappointed with this Apple product
6685,2.0, Had it for two years and didn’t think of buying the extended warranty as you’d think with the name of “Apple” it meant American even though made in China
6686,2.0, Nope just another Chinese POS product
6687,2.0, Thanks Apple for taking my money in me buying this one of a kind worthless junk novelist item
6688,2.0, So appreciative
6689,2.0, But lived up to the standards of its other products living vicariously through them such as their phones lasting about two years
6690,2.0, Criminal
6691,1.0,I purchased this back in October
6692,1.0," When I received them I notice a like burned spot inside the case, but because I have very little time to worry about small marked I decided to overlook "
6693,1.0," Every time I used them no one could hear me on the other end, i was traveling, so I was going to deal this in a later day"
6694,1.0," When I finally return I contacted Amazon, I was told that was to late and to have apple care deal with the issue, when I called Apple care I discover that not only the serial number was not listed "
6695,1.0," no date of manufacturing, and possibly a refurbished item"
6696,1.0, Now they don’t even turn on
6697,1.0, I called amazon and the response was 
6698,1.0, too bad go to Apple care
6699,1.0, Amazon as changed
6700,1.0, i this point I am to believe they selling refurbished item for new
6701,1.0, they costumers support is unsupported
6702,1.0, they disconnected the call while I was talking
6703,5.0,Had these air pods for 10 months
6704,5.0, Still works great
6705,5.0," Just advise that you have to clean these periodically, as it will tend to get dirty very quickly"
6706,5.0,These air pods are quite light and very durable which is expected for a product coming from Apple
6707,5.0," Sound quality is nice, but there are other air pods out there that may perform better"
6708,5.0," So far, its status for longevity is still being observed, as I only had it for 10 months"
6709,5.0, I will keep this post updated if anything changes from this product
6710,5.0,I started teaching my yoga classes via zoom out of necessity
6711,5.0," I set up my iPad and everything worked great, except the sound"
6712,5.0, I had to speak at full volume for anyone to hear me
6713,5.0, It was exhausting
6714,5.0, Then another teacher recommended these
6715,5.0, I was hesitant to spend so much money hoping for a less costly solution
6716,5.0, Finally gave these a try and I’m sorry it took so long
6717,5.0, I can have my head down in a pose demonstrating and talking and can be heard by everyone
6718,5.0, Love them
6719,5.0, And I use them for listening to music or movies too
6720,5.0, Brilliant product
6721,5.0,I got these for a good price on Black Friday - I never used earbuds much because they were uncomfortable and/or didn’t fit right
6722,5.0, I’ve been using them every day since they arrived
6723,5.0, The sound quality is good ‘nuf for me and I like the fit
6724,5.0, I’m a little concerned that some people had problems with them not working after a short time so i will update if that happens
6725,5.0, So far so good
6726,4.0,"reviews say that they are not apple products, that's a lie, they are"
6727,4.0," now with all electronical products that get QC'ed in bulk there is always a chance of product failure, that being said we contacted apple and a free replacement was sent and all is well, the replacement arrived quickly two or three days, but nonetheless quickly, for the value I recommend them, and I recommend the you also by the apple warranty, as it does come in handy, and very easy to use"
6728,5.0,If you are not a fan of silicon plugs and have around 100$ to shell out these 2nd gens are nice as crap
6729,5.0, Something about how fast they connect and I guess my ears evolved specifically for these as they are comfortable
6730,5.0, I don’t regret buying them to any degree
6731,5.0,I never thought I would own a pair of these since I would prefer wired headphones but since I got a new iPhone and it didn’t come with a headphone jack I went ahead and bought this
6732,5.0, So far I’ve been impressed with these AirPods because I could be listening to music or a podcast and just have the phone sitting on a table
6733,5.0, Battery life is excellent since I don’t use it often but I always charge it when I’m done using them
6734,5.0, Overall I’ve been enjoying my AirPods
6735,2.0,Overall I'm impressed with the sound quality
6736,2.0, The connectivity works 90% of the time (sometimes only one Earpod connects)
6737,2.0, Another complains is that there is no external charging light indicator
6738,2.0, You have to open the case to confirm that the device is being charged
6739,2.0, However my biggest complaint is that there is a ridge between the two pieces of molded plastic which has a cutting affect on my ears
6740,2.0, My ears literally bleed after wearing them for a week
6741,2.0," These are my second Generation 2 Apple EarPods, both have the same problems"
6742,2.0," For the price, I expect more from Apple"
6743,2.0,The airbuds worked great for a few weeks and then the right earbud stopped working completely
6744,2.0, I tried everything to get it to work - reconnecting
6745,2.0, Called Apple customer service and they said i would need to pay $70 and return the earbud that wasn't working and they would send me a new one
6746,2.0, What kind of warranty is that
6747,5.0,These Airpods came in brand new as expected
6748,5.0, I got these for my girlfriend since she got me some so I had to return the favor haha
6749,5.0, They have an amazing sound quality and they connect to your phone almost right away
6750,5.0, It’s a little more difficult for people like me who only use one side most of the time since sometimes they won’t catch that it’s in your ear but they’re still great products
6751,5.0,"The charging speed of Airpods is INSANE, you can fully charge them in like 30 minutes"
6752,5.0, When your Airpods die you can put them in the case and they’ll get charged most of the way in like 10 minutes and they still last a long time before having to charge them
6753,3.0,Overall AirPods are a good product and they do well for what they are intended
6754,3.0," Apple’s standard ear bud design (like these) really sucks, and so my wife likes these, but I refuse to use any Apple’s standard bud design devices anymore, because the design sucks so bad and they constantly fall out (AirPods Pro in-ear design is far better, but AirPods Pro are even more of a rip-off than these standard AirPods)"
6755,3.0," My bottom-line recommendation, is if you can live with the heavier and larger Amazon Echo Buds, the latter are a FAR better value for the money, and work just as well as AirPods"
6756,1.0,"Once I dropped my AirPod at TSA, I turned around 2 seconds later to find the one AirPod and the feature to find my that was ringing stopped though the AirPod wasn’t dead"
6757,1.0, Since then I haven’t been able to connect my other AirPod all though my AirPod is charged and all
6758,1.0, I tried to reset and nothing
6759,1.0, So now I need to buy a whole new set
6760,1.0," I have insurance, so hopefully I can get it resolved"
6761,5.0,"I have only had the AirPods for a few days but for those of you who have wondered if any of the knock offs are comparable to the Apple AirPods, my answer is that at least the one I tried is not"
6762,5.0," The charging case and earbuds look almost identical to the Apple AirPods, but that’s where the similarities end"
6763,5.0," The knock-off’s earbuds don’t fit the ear the same way and fall out easily, the connection between the iPhone and the earbuds is spotty, the battery life is not anywhere near what the AirPods offer, and controlling the knockoff is a nightmare"
6764,5.0," If you’re waffling about spending the money and you really want excellent sound quality and the rest of the differences, spend it"
6765,5.0," Yes they are priced higher than I wish they were, but the difference is worth it, at least from my perspective"
6766,5.0,1
6767,5.0,) First I was disappointed with the fit in my ear
6768,5.0, My old Apple wired Earbuds sounded better
6769,5.0,It can be tricky to position them in your ears
6770,5.0, I played around with them for a time until I was getting the full spectrum of sound
6771,5.0, With my ears the stem of the Airpods have to be at about 45degrees pointing forward
6772,5.0,2
6773,5.0,) Many people question if they are 2nd Gen Airpots
6774,5.0, Mine are
6775,5.0,If the model number is A2031 or A2032 then they are 2nd Generation
6776,5.0, People should go to the Apple website/Airpod support and read everything about the different versions of Airpods and Cases
6777,1.0,"I bought this ""NEW"" airpods, and NOT ONLY they where used, but they where BROKEN"
6778,1.0,"As I got them more than 60 days later than when I bought them, amazon did not return me the money and there was nothing that they could do"
6779,1.0,"Luckily the airpods are originals, so apple did change both earbuds"
6780,1.0," But I lost 5 month of warranty and of course the charging case is used, as the airpods were being used since September 2020 by I dont know who and I got them on February 2021"
6781,4.0,DON’T LET YOUR CHARGING CASE GET TO 0% BATTERY
6782,4.0,I have owned these AirPods for a little over a month
6783,4.0," During that time, my AirPods where amazing, great sound quality, great battery life, and it doesn’t fall out the ears"
6784,4.0, It’s way better than the standard earphones that you get with a new iPhone
6785,4.0,"The problem occurred when I let my charging case get to 0% battery for the first time, I didn’t think it would do much since I could always charge it"
6786,4.0," Unfortunately, the charging case was completely unresponsive, it never turned back on despite leaving it charging for more than a day (yes I used different chargers and yes they all worked on my phone)"
6787,4.0, I contacted apple about it and I was offered a $40 replacement for a problem I didn’t ask for
6788,4.0, Apple is so greedy lol
6789,4.0," Nevertheless the product is solid for the most part, just never let the charging case reach 0%"
6790,5.0,I love them
6791,5.0, I’ve been one of those people who never wanted earbuds but i finally decided to try them as they were on sale
6792,5.0," I’m so glad i did, i love them"
6793,5.0," The sound is great, no noise and they last a long time battery-wise"
6794,5.0," I have tinnitus in my ears so I’m a little hard of hearing but with these i have no problem hearing, somehow it knocks the tinnitus out, wish the hearing aid worked as good"
6795,2.0,I purchased these AirPods for $99
6796,2.0, After receiving them and charging them overnight I use them for one hour
6797,2.0, the left AirPod lost 50% of its power during that one hour of use
6798,2.0, I contacted Apple to see if I could get a warranty replacement
6799,2.0, After confirming the serial number several times Apple was not able to confirm the legitimacy of the AirPods
6800,2.0, I immediately sent them back to Amazon
6801,2.0,They appear to be legitimate
6802,2.0, They look to be brand new the packaging appeared to be new and legitimate
6803,2.0, However I got a little gun shy after Apple could not verify the serial number
6804,3.0,I keep losing these because they just wont fit snug
6805,3.0, They're not noise cancelling so i hear a bunch of crap
6806,3.0,"But if apple keeps making these damn things, i will keep buying"
6807,3.0," heard they announced a 500$ earpod, just take all my money now"
6808,3.0,"these aren't particulary great headphones, just hip and you gotta ""get in with the crowd"""
6809,4.0,I LOVE the quality of these ear buds
6810,4.0, The issue I have is that twice in a week the right one has quit working
6811,4.0, I have had these less than a week
6812,4.0, I think they arrived on Monday
6813,4.0, I had to delete off my phone and then reinstall them to make it work
6814,4.0, Then yesterday the right one turned off
6815,4.0, I could not get it to come back on
6816,4.0, I put them in case and it showed battery was just 3%
6817,4.0, I wear them all day but probably did not use them to talk on phone but maybe one time for about 5 min
6818,4.0, They do not seem to be holding a charge for very long
6819,4.0, That is quite disappointing
6820,4.0, They should for sure hold the charge at least the entire day
6821,5.0,I gave sound quality a 4 star because overall that is how I view them
6822,5.0," Listening to music, ummm not so optimal but it is bearable but this come from someone that has Bose headphones"
6823,5.0," But I didn't purchase these for music obviously, so the features it has and the quality of sound for call taking is great"
6824,5.0, It actually what I expected and exceeded expectations which is why i bought the less expensive version only used for taking calls on the go and around the house
6825,5.0," Perfect for that plus have almost the same features as the pro, honestly we think too much into headhones when purchasing them, their headphones, very expensive ones but these are used for what"
6826,5.0," taking calls , reading text being able to be wireless not for anything complicated like operating a computer lol okay ill go now, im just saying"
6827,5.0," Don't spend the money if your confused on which one to get, get this one it will work just as good as the others with the same features besides transparency and I have that when I choose, its called pause whatever im doing and move on"
6828,5.0," Hope this helped, be blessed"
6829,5.0, :)
6830,5.0,"out of all the buds I have tried, these are really top notch for music, they don't seal your ear, so theirs no ear pressure, the call quality is outstanding"
6831,5.0, I can hear everything quite clearly on the other end when I call my wife
6832,5.0," It was not like that with all the other wireless buds I have tried, including my pair of BeatsX"
6833,5.0, It's like it's a wired connection
6834,5.0, The new H1 chip is really great
6835,5.0," That being said, they are not as comfortable as my beatsX, I can wear those all day"
6836,5.0, These I couldn't wear for more than 20 mins before they started hurting my ears alot
6837,5.0," If you have small ears, these may do the same for you and you may need the beatsX style earbuds like me"
6838,5.0,"I recently upgraded my AirPods - I have a 2017 pair, and I just upgraded to a 2020 pair"
6839,5.0, It's absolutely worth it
6840,5.0,The battery life is so much better
6841,5.0," Also, it reads your texts to you and Siri will even let you text back just by talking to her"
6842,5.0, These ones are so much better
6843,5.0,Highly recommended - worth the money
6844,1.0,These are Previously Owned
6845,1.0, not new
6846,1.0, Mine belonged to Dr
6847,1.0, Antonio
6848,1.0," In addition, they had scuff marks on the case as well, with a bit of Dr Antonios hand grease or pocket dirt on the case button"
6849,1.0," Incredibly, they were sealed like a new pair"
6850,1.0," If you don't want a used pair, avoid these"
6851,1.0," These work fine, but I did not pay for a used item, or should I say Preowned"
6852,1.0,Good point is that Amazon took care of me on this purchase
6853,1.0, Thank you Amazon
6854,1.0, SHAME on you APPLE STORE
6855,1.0, Shameful sales practice
6856,1.0,I bought these as a gift
6857,1.0," Not used or refurbished, NEW"
6858,1.0, Upon receiving I noticed the plastic wrap was missing
6859,1.0," I opened the box and all appeared to be ok, the wrap around the case was intact, information was there, charge cord there"
6860,1.0,"When I gave the gift, we opened up to charge and I saw it didn’t look shiny and new- there were scratches"
6861,1.0, And then from my pictures you can see they are dirty- with someone’s earwax
6862,1.0, Ewwwww
6863,1.0,I am promptly sending back and will re purchase at a store where I can see they are brand new
6864,1.0,"I personally love my air pods and so does my son, but I would not recommend purchasing them unseen"
6865,5.0,I have only had these about a week so we will see how they do over time but my first impressions are very positive
6866,5.0, I have had two sets of cheaper ear phones that have had horrible battery life and pretty short lives overall so I decided to spend the money on Apple air-pods this time
6867,5.0, The battery time is much better and when they do need to be charged the fact that they recharge in their carrying case is a big deal
6868,5.0, I've gone a couple of days without having to plug them back in to a power source
6869,5.0, Sound quality has been good to this point
6870,3.0,I had two issues with these ear buds (which I eventually returned)
6871,3.0," First, I do not have an apple phone, and while the ear buds are supposed to work with other devices - and they do - the sound quality is quite poor"
6872,3.0, the volume level is just so-so at max volume
6873,3.0, I was disappointed because the item I wanted them to work with was an Apple product (IPod Nano)
6874,3.0, I took it to the Apple store near me and the tech person who worked with me agreed
6875,3.0," So, if you are buying to work with your Apple phone (which my wife has), they are fine"
6876,3.0, Other than that and you will be disappointed
6877,2.0,"the airpods were super good when i first got them, i got them when the airpod “2"
6878,2.0,0” came out and i decided to save money and buy these because i didn’t need the wireless charging feature
6879,2.0," when i got them they worked flawless, if only they had stayed that way"
6880,2.0, they started to cut in and out as if i was walking too far away from them when i was still right next to them
6881,2.0, i searched far and wide to figure out what was wrong with them but no one seemed to have this problem
6882,2.0, i reset them over 100 times pissed off because i had just spent 160 dollars on earbuds that had the durability of paper
6883,2.0, keep in mind i didn’t drop them a single time when this had happened
6884,2.0, i ignored it and just used one earbud
6885,2.0, this became a big problem when i wanted to block out noise when riding the bus etc
6886,2.0," the problem with the airpods is that they don’t block out any noise whatsoever so u find urself turing it up to block out the noise but once it gets quiet you realize ur making ur ears want to die from the loud noise, and once i wanted to use two i noticed it got quiet on one earbud and loud in the other"
6887,2.0, i had heard rumors about them becoming quiet due to wax build up but i made sure my ears stayed clean 24/7
6888,2.0, but it happened to me anyways
6889,2.0," i searched up how to fix it and i used all the things they told me to do, but nothing worked"
6890,2.0," so i did the only thing i knew would actually work, i poked out the mesh inside of the airpod where the music comes out"
6891,2.0," ta da worked like magic, to this day they haven’t become quiet, but they still have the stupid cutting in and out problem"
6892,2.0, anyways if u buy these and they cut in and out go return them because you have a year warranty and i didn’t notice that so don’t mess up like i did and poke out the mesh in the earbud and void ur warranty
6893,5.0,let me start with there are 5 people in my house
6894,5.0," Which all have apple phone, I pads and air pods"
6895,5.0, I got my daughter air pods for Christmas 2019
6896,5.0, Since the left ear bud stopped working and the case has metal fragments in it
6897,5.0, Cleary a defective case
6898,5.0, I called customer support and was given 2 options
6899,5.0, Take it to a apple store or best buy
6900,5.0, All which are closed in PA due to Covid 19
6901,5.0, Or pay a refundable deposit of 59
6902,5.0,00 for the ear bud and 69
6903,5.0,00 for the case
6904,5.0, I don't feel like I should have to make that large of a deposit since they were 99
6905,5.0,00 new
6906,5.0, I asked for a manager
6907,5.0, Who also said that is all I can offer you at this point
6908,5.0, This burned my
6909,5.0,"butt, since I have spent a lot of money on Apple products over the years"
6910,5.0, May I say I my self have switched to Samsung
6911,5.0, At this point I'm tempted to switch my entire family too
6912,5.0, You can be loyal like a dog
6913,5.0, But you will be beat with the news paper for sure
6914,5.0, They won't dare go out of there way to help you
6915,5.0, I'm so over the BS with the customer service dept
6916,1.0,Ordered back in May 2020 charging case isn’t working as of July 2020 so the return window is closed had to go through apple support and they wanted $70 to replace the charging case on top of the $130+ that I had already spent that would make $200
6917,1.0," All I needed was what I payed for, which is a working AirPod case the Earbuds still work"
6918,1.0, So thanks but no thanks
6919,1.0," This is the second pair I’ve gone through from the year prior, I feel absolutely cheated out of my money so yes I am leaving a bad review for the faulty product you sold me"
6920,1.0, Don’t bother at this point trying to make it right
6921,5.0,Great airpods
6922,5.0," Low latency, good sound quality"
6923,5.0, Please put in the dissription that these are GENERATION 2 Airpods so people won't get confused to whether they are getting gen 1 or gen 2 airpods
6924,5.0," I had to look up my serial number on the apple site to make sure, and these are generation 2 airpods"
6925,5.0, not generation 1
6926,5.0, So this is truly the latest model
6927,5.0," And please don't get confused, these are not Pros, but the latest non pro model (generation 2)"
6928,2.0,These were alright until they stopped working
6929,2.0," Overall, the quick connection and being able to have either the right or left earbud in was great"
6930,2.0, They work smoothly with the apple software
6931,2.0," However, I would not recommend these for runners"
6932,2.0, I was unable to keep them in my ear when running and was constantly worried about them falling out
6933,2.0, After three months of regular use the right earbud stopped working
6934,2.0," For something this expensive, they should last much longer"
6935,2.0, I would recommend getting a cheaper pair from somewhere else
6936,2.0, They will work just as well for a fraction of the price
6937,4.0,"Clean standard issue although I would prefer easily the jbl club pro and plus for 80 bucks but since I am on ios the software is a pleasant surprise for Siri and calls it’s smoother than I could ever imagine, the fit is a bit good and bad it collects grime easily and you should probably buy a case, but it’s a ok value option for a clean experience if you have an iphone"
6938,1.0,The battery Apple used for this product is probably the worst in line
6939,1.0, After half a year of using the airpods literally only last 2 hrs and I had to alternate …
6940,1.0,"And after using these for about a year, my friends told me my voice over the phone was choppy and was hard to pick up"
6941,1.0, I tested a few times and found out it was the mic in the left pod that wasn’t working
6942,1.0," When I brought these to the Genius Bar they wouldn’t even try to figure out the issue and refused to fix it, simply told me to “buy a new pair”"
6943,1.0,"I’ve been using apple products since Apple Shuffle, iPod, and all the way now to MacBooks and airpods, this is the first time that Apple wouldn’t even try to fix their thing"
6944,1.0," This really pissed me off, I will never recommend anyone to even think about buying their airpods (or pro) simply coz these are bad quality, and the manufacturer will def drop the ball if anything would happen"
6945,5.0,"These are great headphones, I wear them working out and at work and the sounds is great"
6946,5.0," They aren't noise cancelling, but I haven't noticed any issues with it at the gym or at work"
6947,5.0," Sometimes they cut in and out so the connection can be weird, but that may just be my phone, and it's only happened 2-3 times"
6948,5.0, I recommend airpods to everyone I know
6949,5.0, Very convenient to wear and stay in my ears perfectly
6950,1.0,Received the item and the left ear bud didnt work at all
6951,1.0, returned the item
6952,1.0, getting a replacement and we'll see if this one works
6953,1.0,Update: the replacement pair came in and they work just fine
6954,1.0,Says new but they are used
6955,1.0, Someone’s name
6956,1.0,Came up when linked to my phone
6957,5.0, I got these for my 11 year old for Christmas
6958,5.0, He absolutely loves them
6959,5.0, They charge quickly and hold a charge for a while
6960,5.0, My son plays basketball and can be rough
6961,5.0, They work perfect despite being dropped
6962,1.0,"I own many apple products, from phones to iPads to watches to AirPods"
6963,1.0,"I bought 2nd generation AirPods for my son, at the time they were the latest model"
6964,1.0,I have never needed to contact customer service at Apple until now
6965,1.0, It was the worst customer experience ever
6966,1.0," After seven months, the AirPods were no longer functioning normally"
6967,1.0, It took 2 1/2 hours on the phone to find out that I needed to spend $150 to get my warranteed product replaced
6968,1.0, They promised to reimburse me
6969,1.0, But this was not an acceptable solution for me
6970,1.0, I had to spend $150 just to mail back the product and get a replacement
6971,1.0, Then I was told I would be reimbursed
6972,1.0, That price is more than the AirPods are worth today
6973,1.0, And I was told I could not speak to anyone higher up
6974,1.0, I am severely disappointed in apple’s customer service
6975,1.0, And I will rethink any further Apple purchases
6976,5.0,I ordered my husband a set of AirPods
6977,5.0," When delivered, the postman did not follow instructions on where to place packages which are posted all over my place"
6978,5.0, The AirPods were chewed by a dog
6979,5.0, I called amazon and they replaced the set quickly sending me a return label for the damaged one
6980,5.0, I appreciate their fast customer service and that this we resolved so well
6981,5.0, I will continue to order
6982,5.0,"As far as the actual AirPods, I don’t know why we have lived so long without them"
6983,5.0, They’re “smart” switching on when I put them in my ears
6984,5.0, They have a long battery life and great sound
6985,5.0, Love them
6986,1.0,This is my second time buying these airpods because i lost one of pods last time
6987,1.0, But i won’t lie there was a probably with my old pair which i got from the same buyer
6988,1.0, Like the fact that the right bud wouldn't charge sometimes or bluetooth just wouldn’t work
6989,1.0, Now i’m having the same issue and its not even two weeks in since i got these
6990,1.0, Do yourself a favor and get them from the apple store instead
6991,1.0, These are fake
6992,1.0,"Bought a pair off Amazon, and had a lot of connectivity issues"
6993,1.0, Took it to genius bar apple and they replaced both headphones and now the right ear is good volume and the left is nearly non-existent
6994,1.0, don't buy into the hype of apple airpods bc its a lot of money for mediocre product and expensive to replace and because its apple
6995,1.0, There is high demand for support of products which delays service you need to fix issues
6996,1.0,"Update since last review, the right airpod has now gone out"
6997,1.0, Not even a year old and totally worthless
6998,1.0, Worst pair of headphones I've ever had
6999,5.0,This is the real deal
7000,5.0, I thought it might be a copy but no It is Apple
7001,5.0, Thes AirPods are such a convenience
7002,5.0, I can keep my phone near the window where receiption is good and use the airpods for phone calls
7003,5.0, Love them for a walk
7004,5.0, The value of these are great I already owned airpods but lost the right ear peice
7005,5.0, Apple would replace one piece for $63 plus shipping
7006,5.0," This buy from amazon included both ear peices, charging case, cable for $119"
7007,1.0,These replacement AirPods stopped working after a few months with my original charging case
7008,1.0, Took them into an Apple store to be looked at and the tech informed me the AirPods were a replica and not actual Apple brand pods
7009,1.0, In fact when the tech ran the serial number it came back that the same serial number was registered to 28 other fake AirPods out there as well
7010,5.0,Sound quality is good
7011,5.0, I love how smoothly my AirPods synced up with my iPhone straight out of the box and pair immediately when I put them in my ears
7012,5.0," There is not really any noise cancellation, but these do t really claim to so I don’t hold that against them"
7013,5.0, They are surprisingly comfortable to wear
7014,5.0, I use them for work because I am on the phone my entire shift
7015,5.0, The battery life is about 2 hours when talking on the phone before needing charged
7016,5.0, I wish this was longer
7017,5.0," Nice thing is I can take one out and have it charging then switch and charge the other, all without interrupting my calls"
7018,5.0," Really, only complaint is battery life, but I get it"
7019,5.0, They are small and wireless
7020,5.0, Where would they store more energy
7021,5.0, I’m sure that will improve with newer versions
7022,5.0,Gave this as a gift and they really enjoyed the how comfortable it fits within their ears
7023,5.0, Tested out noice cancellation and that feature works like a charm
7024,5.0, They could not hear me speak at all while it was on
7025,5.0,"The quality of the sound from the speakers could be better, but it definitely does the job"
7026,5.0, Battery life is okay lasts about 3-4 hours with music and definitely less with calls
7027,5.0, At least you’ll have the charging case to charge it when not in use
7028,3.0,It’s been almost a year since I bought these and they have officially stopped working
7029,3.0," They connect to my device, they pair, they hold a charge, but the sound doesn’t transmit"
7030,3.0, I’ve tried all the fixes
7031,3.0,they’ve worked in the past but not anymore
7032,3.0, Seriously disappointing
7033,3.0," I was planning on upgrading to the next model, but not if this is what happens"
7034,3.0," When they worked, they worked pretty well, besides not staying in my left ear"
7035,3.0, That’s why I wanted to upgrade
7036,3.0, I’ve gone back to wired headphones
7037,3.0, :-/
7038,4.0,"Bought 3 pair now, one for me"
7039,4.0, and my 2 teens
7040,4.0, I' m hooked
7041,4.0,I use them for international and local US conf calls ALL day long and they are great
7042,4.0," While I do forget they are in , after a long time in my ears, my ears get annoyed/sore"
7043,4.0, I have small ears 
7044,4.0,so I would like if there was a small version or cushion
7045,4.0,"I've been through a seriously long list of bluetooth headphones for exercise and business, and these are definitely the best to date"
7046,1.0,I purchased these initially on the January 31st
7047,1.0, I used them maybe twice
7048,1.0," By then, the case was completely dead and would not charge"
7049,1.0, I tried trouble shooting them by holding down the power button to hard reset and nothing worked
7050,1.0, Returned them on February 11th and am still waiting on a replacement
7051,1.0," I keep having to go in and approve delayed shipments, but I’m about ready to just cancel and order the newer version"
7052,1.0, This is too much of a hassle for earbuds that don’t even fit in my ear properly
7053,5.0,"Bought these because wires are so early 21st century, pleased to say it's a fairly uncompromising product"
7054,5.0," Easy to use, great audio quality (especially considering their size), and they're surprisingly pleasing from a tactile perspective"
7055,5.0,"I suspect other products exist that offer better value and can outperform these from a technical perspective, though I think the airpods are worth their price, they feel ""complete"" from top to bottom"
7056,5.0,"It's especially pleasing considering how many products these days disappoint in some way or another, though I think these fit the bill of a ""premium"" product"
7057,3.0,"First of all, the product title says ""Latest Model"" but I received the air pods generation 1, which may or may not explain my disappointing observations"
7058,3.0, I had a lot of expectations for these air pods because they were $140
7059,3.0," When I used them for the first time, I was shocked at how cloudy/faded out the audio was"
7060,3.0, It also has very little to no noise cancellation
7061,3.0, How do people settle for this
7062,3.0, The battery only lasted me roughly 3 hours and then it had to go back into the charging case
7063,3.0," The only pros was that these air pods looked nice, the fit was comfortable-- I wouldn't recommend it unless you just want it for the hype"
7064,3.0," I've bought cheaper wireless earbuds that sounded much clearer and better and lasted me a few days without charging (7-8 hours of use), I just don't think I got my money's worth with these"
7065,3.0, My recommendation is to definitely do your research on different types of wireless ear buds and what you want out of them before purchasing air pods right away
7066,4.0,If you're looking for something that will be very loud this might not be it
7067,4.0, It has great sound but isn't the loudest product
7068,4.0,They do feel like they are about to fall out when I'm working out every now and then but you can defiantly manage
7069,4.0, I Personally cant go on long runs/ or sprint on a track with them in without adjusting them over and over again
7070,4.0, Yes they have fallen out while doing sprints
7071,4.0,They are comfortable and the battery life on the case and each Air Pod is great
7072,5.0,It was time for new ear buds
7073,5.0, My 2 year old horse shoe around your neck LG ones only worked if you kept your phone in your shirt pocket
7074,5.0, I didn’t want to spend that much money but so glad I did
7075,5.0, They have a thirty foot range inside my house through 2 walls
7076,5.0," The sound is as good as my home stereo, and they work completely with my 4-5 year old IPhone SE and my 7 year old IPad"
7077,5.0, No one makes products like Apple
7078,5.0,"I have tried three earbuds from Jabra, two from JLAB Icon series and one from Axil"
7079,5.0, I wish I had tried these first
7080,5.0, The sound quality is amazing
7081,5.0, They are comfortable to wear and the microphones are great
7082,5.0, The only thing they lack is volume control which would be a very nice feature
7083,5.0," These may not be the latest and greatest, but they are good enough for me"
7084,4.0,I own an android and this is by far the only good product that Apple has
7085,4.0, It works nicely with my phone connects quickly and the sound is great 👍 I would recommend this to my friends the only flaw that I see in this is that you can't skip songs on Android at least
7086,4.0, But yet again this was meant to work with Apple devices so I'm not complaining
7087,4.0, Overall great stuff
7088,4.0, For the price it's a bit expensive but if you get it on sale it's well worth it
7089,1.0,These AirPods never and I mean never connected to any of our phones
7090,1.0, I spent a combination of close to 4 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved
7091,1.0," Finally, amazon said I could return them (after we waited for Apple to answer our call for an hour"
7092,1.0,") overjoyed, we packaged them up and mailed only to find out we lost $30 of what my sixteen year old daughter paid"
7093,1.0, Restocking fee
7094,1.0, They were BROKEN
7095,1.0, Amazon- this is shady and so unlike you
7096,1.0, My daughter worked super hard to earn her money mowing lawns
7097,1.0, You just made her mow four more lawns to rebuy the same headphones
7098,1.0, Pretty rotten
7099,1.0,This product broke just out of warranty
7100,1.0, Not just one pod
7101,1.0,both pods and the charging case have broken with all different issues
7102,1.0, Very disappointed and out a lot of money
7103,5.0,"OMG, I just got my AirPods"
7104,5.0, I put them in and WOW
7105,5.0, The sound is beyond awesome
7106,5.0," I’ve had several sets of wireless earphones, but nothing like this"
7107,5.0, I’ll have to let you know about battery life since I just got them
7108,5.0, They were so easy to pair and then your ready to listen
7109,5.0, Someone told me what a big difference there would be and that’s why I ordered them
7110,5.0, He was so right
7111,5.0, I’m going to enjoy these AirPods
7112,5.0,They took a while to come in but they’re the real deal
7113,5.0,"I bought these to listen to music, but now I use them for everything"
7114,5.0," The coolest thing about these, in my opinion is if you lose one or both you can use the find my iPhone app and it will locate it they chirp till you find it, but if you misplace the complete set with the AirPods in the case, it does not work"
7115,5.0, Which is stupid because that’s how I carry them in my pocket
7116,5.0," Anyhow, it’s a great product I wish I would’ve spent a few more dollars and bought the wireless case"
7117,5.0," And they are waterproof, I did wash them in the case at the laundry mat on heavy soil"
7118,5.0, Cudos
7119,5.0,I love them they sound great work great look great good deal I only needed the 1st gen I understand the 2nd gen is a little more upgraded but who needs it
7120,5.0, All I wanted was the AirPods I had no head phones so I decided why not I bought some little ear covers so they stayed in my ear which was a perfect decision cause now they don’t fall out cause one of my ears would fall out cause not all ears are equal lol
7121,5.0, I would buy if you want to splurge
7122,5.0,"I like how easy to use they are, how good is the sound"
7123,5.0, I like the little charging box
7124,5.0, I have not found a way to control the volume without invoking Siri
7125,5.0, The battery is reasonably durable but I wish it lasted one full day
7126,5.0, Seems to be shorter than a cell phone one
7127,1.0,Worst bluetooth ever
7128,1.0,"After a month use, right earpiece is fading out"
7129,1.0," When I make a call, the part on the other side barely hears"
7130,1.0," Many of this cases were reported to Apple(according to apple support community), but Apple doesn’t even have any solution for a long time"
7131,1.0, This happens to Airpod and Airpod Pro
7132,1.0,But my left part earpiece keep falling out and I can’t even make a call with this bad designed product
7133,1.0,My old $20 Bluetooth or my son’s Galaxy buds works much better than this airpod
7134,3.0,First pair stopped working (wouldn’t connect to devices and right AirPod’s sound would go in and out) after 2 weeks
7135,3.0, Amazon tech support tried to troubleshoot several times but finally they requested that I exchange
7136,3.0, Sent out a new pair that was delivered the next day and UPS picked up the old pair
7137,3.0," Will provide update on new pair, hopefully they will last"
7138,5.0,Gift for my grandson
7139,5.0, He was thrilled to get them
7140,5.0, I also have a pair & that's the reason I bought him a set too
7141,5.0, The quality of the product overall is good
7142,5.0, The sound outside & noise canceling of cars going by is wonderful but you can still tell what's going on around you for safety purposes which was important to me
7143,5.0, They are not waterproof so when walking in the rain I use the hood on my rain jacket to keep them dry
7144,5.0, He said hid was the best gift
7145,1.0,"Within 3 months of purchasing this product, I noticed the headphones did not consistently charge in the case"
7146,1.0, It was very finicky and would lead the the airpods being dead half the time I would reach for them
7147,1.0," Ultimately, I took them to the Apple Store, who then sent them off to be fixed/replaced"
7148,1.0," However, the techs at Apple noticed the serial numbers did not match between the case and the headphones and thus could not be fixed, indicating they were used parts that someone had repackaged as new and sold to me pretending they were a new set"
7149,1.0," Because they were broken and mismatched and apparently bought via a third party and not from Apple via Amazon as I had thought, I was not able to get the product fixed by Apple themselves and instead I have broken AirPods"
7150,1.0,"Oh and the warranty associated with the serial number on the case expired 4 months earlier than when I purchased them, so I was out of luck there as well"
7151,1.0,I purchased these airpods in November
7152,1.0," A few months later, the left airpod stopped working"
7153,1.0, I brought this to an Apple Store for repair
7154,1.0," The gentleman at the Genius Bar said that based on the serial number, this airpod had already been ""replaced"" in the past, and could therefore not be fixed"
7155,1.0," He was nice enough to send in a request to have this error fixed, but, I will need to wait about a week until it can be replaced despite being well into the 1 year warrenty"
7156,1.0, Massive inconvenience
7157,1.0, I am so disappointed Apple didn't do anything to remedy faster
7158,5.0,"I got these as a gift, and I was worried about purchasing these online, and when they arrived they were exactly what you’d get in store but cheaper"
7159,5.0," They work really well, easy to connect, you adjust the settings for them in the blue tooth menu on your iPhone"
7160,5.0, And they stay charged for a long time as well and came with a iPhone charger
7161,5.0, I recommend these if you’re able to not lose them as they can be lost very easily
7162,5.0, They do make cords to attach to them so you can wear them around your neck
7163,5.0," But other then that, I have zero complaints about these AirPods"
7164,5.0, I’m very happy I decided to purchase these through amazon
7165,1.0,This was a used/refurbished product
7166,1.0," After 2 weeks of using them, people could no longer hear me when on the phone"
7167,1.0, The audio quality made me sound like I was underwater
7168,1.0, I purchased these for work and could no longer use them
7169,1.0, I took them to apple and they cleaned them and the problem was still there
7170,1.0, Apple notified me that this was a refurbished product that was returned to amazon before I bought them
7171,1.0, Amazon should really notify a customer that the product is not new so things like this do not happen
7172,5.0,I had borrowed a friend's old AirPods gen 1 for about 3 weeks until I had to give them back
7173,5.0," After one week without AirPods filled with relentless struggle using cheaper wireless earbuds, I realized I had to buy my own pair"
7174,5.0, That one week was torture
7175,5.0,I can't tell you how happy I am to be using these AirPods again
7176,5.0," The design is sleek, slender and pocket-friendly"
7177,5.0, The wireless connection is superb between my iPhone and MacBook
7178,5.0," Plus- if a friend also has airpods, you can ""bump"" your sound and listen to the same song, podcast or tv show coming from one apple device"
7179,5.0,A few things to note: these are NOT the wireless charging (gen 2) airports
7180,5.0, They come with a lightning cable but NOT a charging block
7181,5.0,I love these very much
7182,5.0, I owned a pair of Bluetooth earbuds prior to getting AirPods and I didn’t like them very much because they didn’t stay in my ears and the battery didn’t last very long
7183,5.0, The battery life of these AirPods last for a long time in comparison on a single charge
7184,5.0, They stay connected without difficulty to my iPhone and I couldn’t ask for a better pair of earbuds
7185,5.0, I’m glad I got these for myself
7186,5.0," The sound quality is 10/10 and the noise cancellation is amazing, the best I’ve ever had to be honest"
7187,4.0,The only reason I gave it four stars is because its price is not as good as it is on Black Friday
7188,4.0, I remember only selling 109 at that time
7189,4.0," Of course, the price of amazon is now better than best buy and target"
7190,4.0,"The sound quality is definitely not comparable to beat, but I think it's not bad"
7191,4.0," Used to answer the phone, watching TV is already very good"
7192,5.0,I charged the case and ear buds when they arrived even though they were over 80%
7193,5.0, I used the ear buds for the next six days on my walk
7194,5.0, (1hr & 35min) I put them in the charging case when I returned
7195,5.0, I just checked the ear buds and they are fully charged again
7196,5.0, I'm not sure when I will need to charge the case again
7197,5.0, I love this product
7198,5.0, (I had to return a cheaper set of ear buds before I bought the Apple Ear Buds
7199,5.0, You get what you pay for most times
7200,5.0,)
7201,5.0,I 10/10 recommend buying AirPods but know that you’ll never be able to ever switch to anything else
7202,5.0, I bought my first pair of AirPods three years ago and have been happy with them ever since
7203,5.0, I have also occasionally bought them as gifts for friends/family
7204,5.0, The battery life is amazing
7205,5.0, I use them a lot for work usually listening to music which last me about 7 hours before the 10% warning sign letting you know to charge them
7206,5.0, The AirPod case will usually last me about two days before I need to charge it again
7207,5.0, Also you can track them if lost (iPhone users) on the find my phone app
7208,5.0, It’ll even allow you to play a sound so it’ll be easier to find
7209,5.0, I just don’t see myself ever buying anything but AirPods ever again
7210,5.0, Also I recommend you buy a case for it so it could stay protected and it’s easy access for me since I always attach them on my belt loop
7211,5.0, I truly have never been so sure about recommending something other than AirPods
7212,5.0,"my AirPods were delivered today, I ordered them on Black Friday"
7213,5.0," I read all the reviews to make sure that I wouldn’t be scammed, and although the product had several bad reviews, I ordered them anyways since I really wanted AirPods and they were sold out everywhere else"
7214,5.0," The AirPods came in their original packaging, with everything new and intact"
7215,5.0," They weren’t used, dirty, or damaged"
7216,5.0," Also, a lot of people are saying that amazon is selling first gen AirPods and saying that they’re second gen, but these are second generation AirPods"
7217,5.0, I checked the serial numbers and I’ll attach a picture too
7218,5.0," The reason why there’s no light on the front is because the charging case isn’t a wireless charging case, and it doesn’t say that it comes with one anyways"
7219,5.0, The sound quality is fantastic
7220,5.0," I really love these, they are real Apple AirPods and I suggest buying"
7221,5.0," If I have any issues, I’ll update, but so far so good"
7222,5.0,So I'm not an Apple user at all but these were highly recommended for me to use with my Galaxy Note S10+
7223,5.0, The sound is absolutely amazing
7224,5.0," I could hear artists talking during songs that I've never once heard using my phone with or without headphones, Bluetooth in the car or TV sound bar"
7225,5.0, I'm very impressed
7226,5.0, A pretty long range for the Bluetooth too
7227,5.0, Moved further away from my phone in the house than previously could with phone from soundbar with no sound interruptions
7228,3.0,Sound great
7229,3.0, But they should for the price
7230,3.0, Difficult to fit in and keep in ears
7231,5.0,"For some time, I thought that AirPods were a silly luxury"
7232,5.0, Was I wrong
7233,5.0," Set up was a breeze, sound quality is excellent"
7234,5.0, Texting - my least favorite things to do - is so easy with Siri
7235,5.0," Auto correct for manual texting is a pain, but Siri dictation works beautifully"
7236,5.0,I am a woman who isn't very technically savvy
7237,5.0, I run a business and often need to multi task
7238,5.0," With air pods I can free up my hands , walk both my dogs while answering phone calls and texts, ask Siri to find a news channel, etc, etc"
7239,5.0,I am very happy with this purchase
7240,1.0,"Bought the first generation and two months in the left earpiece would go dead twice as fast as the right, by one year the left earpiece no longer worked at all, the set i bought my daughter also was dead by one year"
7241,1.0," Bought the gen 2 set to replace them hoping things were better and the right earpiece doesn’t fit the case properly, if i don’t hold it down into the case it wont charge"
7242,1.0," Called apple and they were as unhelpful as they were in the past, send us the product you just bought and after a while we’ll send it back and say its within specifications"
7243,1.0, I guess im the idiot for repeating the same mistake
7244,1.0, Im sure they won’t miss me but im done with apple
7245,5.0,Honestly the bad reviews are either people who bought from a 3rd party or are too broke that they are switching their used pods for new ones
7246,5.0, These are great
7247,5.0, Honestly I went for the 2nd gen because I had them before (but I forgot one in my pocket
7248,5.0,and that went in the wash) but liked how they sound
7249,5.0," I also like how they feel in my ear compared to any headphones with the ear rubber pieces, those fall out so easily"
7250,5.0, I was too scared to get the 3rd gen because they look different ear wise and then wouldn't know if I could return it cause it wouldve been opened plus I prefer not to spend more than what I spent on these lol
7251,5.0,I have an different brand that I listen to music when I walk
7252,5.0," They were my husbands and he didn’t like them, so I used them and like them"
7253,5.0, He got air pods and said huge difference
7254,5.0, I kept them off brand ones all summer and just last week got the second generation air pods and omg husband isn’t wrong…
7255,5.0,huge difference in the sound quality
7256,5.0, Love love them
7257,4.0,"My son thought this would be a great deal for me since I use corded headphones frequently, and Amazon had them on a daily special"
7258,4.0," My problem is that they fall out of my ears and I’m afraid I’ll lose one, so I no longer wear them outside or away from homy"
7259,4.0, Batteries give a warning when they’re about to die
7260,4.0, I let both run down before recharging so the charge in each will be even
7261,4.0," Otherwise, one might be at 20% and the other completely dead"
7262,3.0,I really do like my AirPods
7263,3.0, That being said for the price of these things you would really expect better sound quality as well as noise cancellation
7264,3.0, The battery life is excellent but overall I have to say I would like a higher quality sound with ear plugs
7265,3.0," I use these while riding my motorcycle and have to put them upside down and in opposite years in order to not lose them while I’m riding down the road Not the best use for motorcycle cruising, but work okay otherwise, just not great sound"
7266,1.0,"Hey there,"
7267,1.0,"I purchased these ""New"" Airpods and when I connected them they were already registered as Akki's Airpods"
7268,1.0," Addititonally, the left Airpod does not work"
7269,1.0, Complete scam
7270,1.0, I will be returning them promptly
7271,5.0,The only earbud to last the promised playtime and no of charges from the case
7272,5.0,All other earbuds do not even come close to meeting their promised spec
7273,5.0,Looks pricey but I feel the one time ~100$ investment on this ear bud is better experience compared to the cheaper <50$ versions which you will end up replacing after warranty expires
7274,5.0, Typically the cheaper products are designed to work till their warranty period with the occasional good one
7275,5.0, I recommend this unless you are feeling lucky
7276,4.0,"I have an Android, but Airpods are better than other truely-wireless earbuds, plus airpods are the only earbuds with cases you can add that are cool and cute"
7277,4.0," I absolutely love them and have had no issues other than the fact that they loose connection for a split second, but I figured its because I dont actually have them connected to another Apple product"
7278,4.0," And as for background noise, I can still hear everything happening around me unless I obviously have the volume all the way up"
7279,5.0,I was reluctant to move from corded earbuds to these but must admit they are great
7280,5.0, Worried they'd fall out of my ears-they don't
7281,5.0, worried they would drain my battery fast and die quickly-so far they haven't
7282,5.0, I know I am a late bloomer on these-but glad to finally join the rest of you and be cord free
7283,5.0,After owning a pair of AirPods myself for a long while I bought two pairs for my teens
7284,5.0, They BOTH love them
7285,5.0, Super easy to use and the great quality that you would expect from Apple
7286,5.0, My kids are so happy they no longer have to worry about the cords
7287,5.0, Sound quality is fabulous and they stay in their ears when they workout
7288,5.0, I thought about buying the cheaper brand until I heard of how they stop working so I'm glad that I went ahead and bought quality
7289,5.0, it shows
7290,5.0, I bought silicon covers for the cases with clips as well
7291,5.0, Super fast delivery
7292,5.0,These are 100% legit Gen 2 AirPods
7293,5.0," For all the people saying the charging indicator light should be on the outside of the case for Gen 2 cases, I bought a pair of G2 AirPods from Verizon and they’re IDENTICAL"
7294,5.0," From everything I’ve seen, the Gen 2 cases with the charging indicator light on the outside are the WIRELESS charging cases"
7295,5.0, I looked up the model numbers (A2032 A2031 each AirPod) (A1602 charging case) all say Gen 2
7296,5.0,"Easy to use, most of the time"
7297,5.0, Works with ALL my devices
7298,5.0, Easier to use with Apple products
7299,5.0, Battery life is no problem
7300,5.0, Sound is good
7301,5.0, Fit is good
7302,5.0, No opinion on noise cancellation - headphones are better
7303,5.0," It was more than I wanted to pay for wireless earpods/buds, whatever, but you get what you pay for"
7304,5.0," If they last, it will be worth the money"
7305,5.0, Easy to lose
7306,5.0,Two months later: lost an ear pod while walking on a grass field
7307,5.0, Fortunately some kind soul found it in the park where I was walking and placed it on a park bench
7308,5.0, Like looking for a needle in a haystack
7309,5.0," It still works but as I said, they’re easy to lose"
7310,5.0,So I originally bought some generic pods
7311,5.0,"that sucked because the battery life was all of maybe 6 hrs, no charging case"
7312,5.0, So I returned them and sprung for the real airpods
7313,5.0, I have not regretted it
7314,5.0, The battery life is amazing
7315,5.0, My right ear tends to hurt slightly having the pod in but not such an issue with a plastic cover on it
7316,5.0, The connectivity and setup is AMAZINGLY easy
7317,5.0, I have two Iphones and the airpods connect effortlessly
7318,5.0, I recommend these airpods
7319,5.0,"Hasta ahora me siento bien con ellos, me gusta pra trabajar y puedo escuchar todo el entorno k me rodea"
7320,3.0,These air pods are maybe great for young people
7321,3.0," The battery only seem to last 2 or 3 hours, which is unreal to me"
7322,3.0," Kept falling out of my ear, lucky I haven’t lost one"
7323,3.0," Don’t notify you have a call, so you have to keep the phone out to answer it"
7324,3.0, Another problem
7325,3.0, I would return them if I could
7326,3.0, Will check to see if there is a time limit
7327,3.0, I miss my old ones so bad
7328,3.0, I recently changed over to all Apple products in December 2019
7329,3.0, I love my phone though
7330,3.0, I will look for other alternatives for these 
7331,3.0, Bought accessories & other pieces trying to make these work
7332,3.0, No luck
7333,5.0,I love my AirPods
7334,5.0," This older model requires a lightning wire connection to recharge, but works great"
7335,5.0, (Newer versions can charge on a charging pad)
7336,5.0," I use one bud at a time and alternate ears, recharging the unused, one so they can be used all day, then recharge the case overnight"
7337,5.0, The case can recharge the buds in 15 minutes several times before needing to be recharged itself
7338,5.0, If I could only remember where I left the case
7339,5.0,I love my Apple iPods
7340,5.0, The charge last for at least two days it seems
7341,5.0, I had a 5 1/2 hour flight and had music playing the entire flight and they never died unlike my previous Beats Wireless headphones that died after 3 hours
7342,5.0, The sound quality is perfect and when I’m on conference calls everyone on the call can hear me perfectly without any background noise or static
7343,5.0," I definitely recommend these for any working professional like myself, that travels extensively for work and has to attend multiple conferences calls everyday, many of which I am having to give a presentation to prospective clients or my team"
7344,1.0,Appears to be a genuine product
7345,1.0, However; when installed already had someone else's name pop up when I synced the EarPods to my phone
7346,1.0, I expected to purchase a NEW product
7347,1.0, Nothing in the ad suggests otherwise
7348,1.0, This is not cool
7349,5.0,I finally broke down and bought myself some
7350,5.0, I love the way they fit securely in my ears
7351,5.0," I’m another person who has small ears, and some buds just won’t fit/stay in"
7352,5.0, Or maybe WE have perfect ears and the buds are made wrong
7353,5.0, They hold a charge for many many hours of use
7354,5.0, My only issue is getting them out of the cute little case
7355,5.0,"I seem to drop one every time, but that’s no biggie"
7356,5.0," I wish there were a little ring on the case, like some of the storage cases"
7357,5.0, I highly recommend
7358,5.0,I have small ear canals and worried about comfort but these are the best I've ever used
7359,5.0," I love the sound and usually if I'm going to be outside and need to hear other things happening, I just use one at a time and it works great"
7360,5.0," The connection between them and my phone is great, and I can be long distances from my phone or leave the phone in the house and they still work"
7361,2.0,I feel like we have to replace and buy a new set every 2-4 months
7362,2.0, I rely heavily on using the AirPods having to be on the phone a lot
7363,2.0," Suddenly people on the other end of the line are not hearing me well or claim that I have a bad connection, even though reception is clear"
7364,2.0," When switching to phone, everything is fine"
7365,2.0, I have done numerous tries to troubleshoot with no luck
7366,5.0,I ordered these based on the reviews
7367,5.0, The sound quality is amazing
7368,5.0," I already have an Apple phone, so perfect fit"
7369,5.0, This model is really comfortable for my ears
7370,5.0," I know a lot of people prefer the smaller ear buds, but I don’t have a problem with this design"
7371,5.0, Phone calls come through perfect too
7372,5.0, I would definitely recommend
7373,5.0," Easy to charge, absolutely love these:)"
7374,5.0,These little Airpods are great
7375,5.0, I had done extensive research before getting these and had seen a lot of hate online towards these earbuds by many tech reviewers
7376,5.0," I’m not a audiophile, but I think these have awesome sound quality"
7377,5.0," Plus, they work great with an iPhone with the instant pairing"
7378,5.0, Are they expensive
7379,5.0, Sure
7380,5.0, Don’t fit in everyone’s ears
7381,5.0, True
7382,5.0, But they are worth it in my opinion
7383,5.0," Better yet, get them on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday"
7384,5.0, They were $99
7385,5.0,99 for the 2020 holiday season
7386,1.0,These are are wonderful sounding but sadly the right air pod quit working after 2 months
7387,1.0, I have talked to Amazon customer service three times and they have been wonderful
7388,1.0, We have done all the “trouble shooting “ tips and have been able to get them working
7389,1.0, But the next day the right side is again not working
7390,1.0, This is my second set of air pods
7391,1.0, I had the first generation but the microphone went out after 6 months so no one could hear me when I would talk a call
7392,1.0, I waited for the 2 nd generation and finally got a pair delivered on July 7 
7393,1.0, It’s September 10 and after three tries with Amazon customer service I will be calling Apple
7394,1.0, I’m not hopeful and don’t recommend
7395,1.0," I only use these when walking outside so it’s not like they are getting a lot of rough, sweaty use"
7396,4.0,This is definitely brand new AirPods
7397,4.0," Unfortunately, I lost my AirPods yesterday"
7398,4.0, Guess someone already took it
7399,4.0, I really like this product
7400,4.0," However, it is way easy to lose it"
7401,4.0," I’m very frustrated since I purchased this last month, Except high risk of losing it"
7402,4.0,The price just dropped $30
7403,4.0, What a bummer 
7404,4.0, I’m a broke student who saved up money for this product
7405,4.0, I can’t believe that I overpaid it again 
7406,4.0, First is my refurbished printer
7407,4.0, Now it’s the AirPods
7408,4.0, Can I still trust Amazon 
7409,4.0, Dumbest purchase ever
7410,5.0,By now I'm sure everyone knows these Apple airpods
7411,5.0, The only thing I wish they'd do is curb out background noise for construction people
7412,5.0, My husband is a locksmith and frequently is cutting things in the background
7413,5.0," If he's on his and I'm on mine and he cuts a key, I sometimes jump a little at the pain coming into my eardrums"
7414,5.0," Other than that, for people who don't make loud noise all day, they're obviously very convenient and comfortable"
7415,4.0,Pros:
7416,4.0,Great sound and mic quality
7417,4.0," (not a music person, talking about calls)"
7418,4.0,Put it on and start listening; very easy to use
7419,4.0,Cons:
7420,4.0,"When you need to share it with someone (OK, for some this might sound gross for an in-ear device, but my wife and I came to terms with it, lol); the whole second point above is gone"
7421,4.0, You need to go to bluetooth menu etc like any other headphone
7422,4.0,"For non-iPhone, the whole ease-of-use is probably not there"
7423,4.0,The touch actions on the earpieces are not very flexible
7424,4.0," There are some good actions like Previous track, next track, Siri, etc"
7425,4.0," but I wanted things like Pause call, Unmute mic"
7426,4.0, the things that might come in handy at a conference call
7427,4.0, That is not there for AirPods
7428,4.0, at least until Apple wants to bring it to the next iOS
7429,2.0,When this product arrived there was a buzzing sound in the right earpod
7430,2.0, Upon contacting Amazon about the issue they put us in contact with Apple and we have had to ship the product back to Apple for evaluation
7431,2.0, We ordered the refurbished product with the belief that it would be functional
7432,2.0, It was not
7433,2.0,"Overall the customer service was great from Amazon, but I am now leery of purchasing refurbished again"
7434,5.0,I recently got an iPhone 12 mini and caved in and bought these
7435,5.0, Yes they're pricey but worth it IMO
7436,5.0,Very easy to use and so convenient
7437,5.0, The sound is better than I expected
7438,5.0, I like that you can feel the bass well
7439,5.0, Sometimes they do slip out but you have to try out which way works best for you/your ears
7440,1.0,I can honestly say this was a bad investment
7441,1.0, I wanted them so that I can talk on the phone with them in but they continue to disappoint
7442,1.0, The battery life is horrible
7443,1.0, The left never has as much charge as the right and so I walk around with one AirPod in
7444,1.0, The sound quality is so so
7445,1.0, Not the best I heard from my other wireless headphones
7446,1.0, I’m really disappointed at the price because I feel like these are cheap products that Apple made and tried to pass off as worth your money when they aren’t
7447,1.0, They’re worst quality than wireless headphones that cost half the amount they do
7448,1.0," Overall, don’t buy these"
7449,5.0,The main appeal for me was that the Apple earphone design was actually better fitting for my smaller ears
7450,5.0, Silicone tips genuinely bothered me enough that I switched and I'm glad for it
7451,5.0, These do work for general sound quality
7452,5.0," Honestly the extra mobility I get while I work is what makes these amazing, and the easy connectivity to my phone and laptop"
7453,5.0,This is my first set of AirPods
7454,5.0, I got them so I would be able to listen to music and podcasts while doing other tasks and charging my phone
7455,5.0," So far, so good"
7456,5.0, The sound quality sounds great
7457,5.0, Next time I’ll get the wireless because constantly having to charge another device is a bit much
7458,5.0, Also I notice that it’s easy to lose AirPods around the house and the Find Me app on iPhone has not been helpful in finding them
7459,5.0, Otherwise I think this is a good buy
7460,5.0,I’ve had these things for about a year now and they have been used almost everyday
7461,5.0," I was really skeptical when I first got these and I thought they were fake, they weren’t, and a lot of people say that they’re fake which threw me off but they’re real"
7462,5.0," The battery life is good although the left one dies faster then the right, but what can you say when you use these all day everyday"
7463,5.0," As far as the sound goes, it’s good, not 500 dollar stereo overear headphones but it’s good"
7464,5.0,"Like any other Apple product, these AirPods are amazing"
7465,5.0," Easy to connect to your iPhone, super intuitive to use, great range (distance from your phone), the sound quality is great, small in size"
7466,5.0, The fact that you can recharge them directly from the case is another great plus
7467,5.0," When you're not using them, just place them back in the case and they recharge on their own"
7468,5.0," I was so happy with this purchase, that I bought another set for my husband and one for my daughter"
7469,5.0, Highly recommends
7470,5.0,I had purchased a cheaper pair that I found online
7471,5.0," They turned off unexpectedly, the battery ran down quickly you never know when they were going to work"
7472,5.0, So I got tired of the problems and ordered these Apple AirPods with Charging Case
7473,5.0, I just love them
7474,5.0, I have had no problems of any kind
7475,5.0, They have work beautifully from day one
7476,5.0, I wish I had not wasted my $50 on those other ones and just bought these the first time
7477,5.0, They have great battery life
7478,1.0,Total junk
7479,1.0, After 5 weeks of used they stopped working
7480,1.0, I called for support and was not provided any assistance from Amazon services who sold them
7481,1.0, What a waste of 150 for 5 weeks
7482,1.0, Beware of buying simrkg g that Amazon will not stand behind
7483,5.0,I had doubt on the $150 price for this Apple AirPods when it came out because it's so hard to justify the cost
7484,5.0," I've had several wireless headphones before the AirPods, notably Motorola M9 and M10, and some other generic brands"
7485,5.0, None of them is truly wireless when compared to the AirPods
7486,5.0," Most importantly, the AirPods feels comfortable when I wear it for a long time"
7487,5.0," This is is one major reason I bought this because the AirPods Pro, though incredible for it's noise canceling, is not suitable for long-time wearing"
7488,5.0," The battery of my older first generation AirPods is not good anymore, so I got this newer generation for $99 when it's on sale"
7489,5.0, I think it's a great deal and a must buy
7490,5.0,I was super against hopping on the AirPod bandwagon for a while I will admit
7491,5.0, But these were on sale and I was on an online shopping spree and said why not
7492,5.0, And I am so so so glad I bought them and so sad I waited so long to buy them
7493,5.0, Great audio and noise cancelling
7494,5.0, They stay in amazingly
7495,5.0, I’ve worked out and had a bedroom dance party to test them and they stay in and sound is great the whole time
7496,4.0,"El producto lo considero de buena calidad como es costumbre en los productos de Apple, pero me desagradó q después de haber pagado y recibido el producto, encuentro un cargo adicional en la cuenta con la q realicé el pago procedente de Amazon (sin explicaciones), cargo q no sé de donde se originó y mucho menos comprendo cómo Amazon pudo entrar a mi cuenta y hacer un cargo sin mi autorización"
7497,4.0, Lo considero una falta de respeto y un atrevimiento mayor
7498,4.0," (Lo único q puedo pensar al buscar una justificación es q sea por motivos de tazas de cambio entre monedas, y es q aún así la conversión la hace su sistema automáticamente, así q sigo sin comprender la razón del cargo adicional a mi cuenta incluso después de pagado y recibido el producto) Cuento con evidencias desde q hice el pedido, el valor al cual valoraron el dollar, y del cargo mencionado"
7499,1.0, These came clearly used
7500,1.0," Somebody else’s name already assigned to them, ear wax in both headphones (yuck), and a case that rattles"
7501,1.0,Pretty lame to sell used stuff as new
7502,5.0,"I never thought I’d own a pair of these, but after my corded Apple earphones got ripped out while working out 4-5 times, I said enough is enough and bought these"
7503,5.0, I’m so glad I did
7504,5.0," The sound quality it great, they don’t hurt my ears, and they never fall out"
7505,5.0, Not to mention the Siri function is extremely useful when working out
7506,5.0," I still think they’re a tad bit expensive for what they are, but that’s Apple for you"
7507,5.0,I live for these AirPods
7508,5.0, They’re so sickening and make me feel like a bad binch whenever I walk into Walmart cause then I look around at everyone else that’s AirPod-less I’m like “hmm
7509,5.0, smells like broke in here” and I strut down those aisles living my rich woman fantasy even though nobody is looking at me
7510,5.0, These AirPods make me feel like all eyes are on me baby
7511,5.0," I am a Leo tho, so maybe that explains things"
7512,5.0," Anyways, the only reason I’m able to live my fantasy is because of these AirPods so I definitely recommend dropping that coin sis"
7513,5.0, I even got my cister a pair too so she can strut down her college hallways and live her own bad binch fantasy
7514,5.0," AirPods are life changing, like honestly"
7515,5.0," So yeah, get some"
7516,1.0,SCAM
7517,1.0, These were not new
7518,1.0, Not even close
7519,1.0," They were originally bought 1,457 days ago"
7520,1.0, Found this out when I had to call Apple support because when I received them the left side never worked
7521,1.0, They said to fix them would be $145 because they were out of warranty…
7522,1.0, That’s how I found out how very old they truly were
7523,1.0, I’m LIVID
7524,1.0, So much for that Christmas present for my son
7525,5.0,Very happy with these headphones
7526,5.0," For years I have been buying either knock off blue tooth headphones that either do not fit in my ears (they are small), stay in place during activity (such as running) and or are not compatable with my iphone"
7527,5.0," It is quite expensive, however worth it for wireless headphones that actually work for all of the above issues I had with previous headphones"
7528,5.0, The only downside is that occasionally the headphones are slow or delayed to react to a song change (with the double tap) or will fall out easily if I hit them accidentally
7529,5.0," Otherwise they do stay in place well, I am just an accident prone person"
7530,5.0," The case is also nice so I do not loose them (as this is often a problem for me, lol)"
7531,5.0, I definitely recommend spending the extra $$ for these if you have an iphone
7532,5.0,"these are my first Bluetooth earbuds, I was kind of late to the party (and still am since I'm getting the wired case ones)"
7533,5.0," Honestly, no regrets"
7534,5.0, I'm so happy that I can just walk around my small apartment with my podcasts or music playing
7535,5.0, It's also super nice without any wires anywhere when I need to use them in public
7536,5.0," The audio is really great for me, almost too good"
7537,5.0," The first few days I had it, I would listen to lectures and I could pick up sounds that made me think someone was near me and it would freak me out lol"
7538,5.0,I love these AirPods
7539,5.0," I ended up getting a pair of Pros after because they didn’t fit my ears, but I was still very impressed with these"
7540,5.0,Pros (ha): Call quality is crystal clear
7541,5.0, Range is excellent- I could hear my calls from the basement all the way to the 2nd floor
7542,5.0," They snap in the case perfectly, and the case is tiny and fits easily in my pocket"
7543,5.0, Sound quality is good
7544,5.0,Cons: Bad fit - not good for small ear canals like mine
7545,5.0," Ambient sounds can be a bit loud (didn’t expect noise cancellation, though)"
7546,5.0," Stems are long and awkward looking, and therefore easier to knock out"
7547,3.0,Great except the Left one falls out
7548,3.0, Fell out getting into my car
7549,3.0, Fell out multiple times as I ate dinner
7550,3.0, I really wanted to like these but if I’m always afraid one will just fall out then what good are they
7551,5.0,LOVE THEM
7552,5.0,Everything about them pair so well with my iPhone
7553,5.0, Sound quality is through the roof and the noise cancellation is one thing that will come in handy on the busy roads
7554,5.0, The battery life lasts so long too
7555,5.0, They came very secure so they weren’t damaged and everything was in place
7556,5.0, Love it
7557,5.0,"I bought these for xmas but decided to let him try them to make sure they were okay, they were not"
7558,5.0,one of them was bad I had to make an appointment at apple and go in they have to replace the
7559,5.0,bad one it might be good for the shipper to check these out before shipping after they wer
7560,5.0,fixed he loved them it was inconvenient to have to go to apple
7561,3.0,"After using the airpods for a week or so, I am not thrilled and for this price, I expect better"
7562,3.0," Although the design is beautiful, it is hard to get them in your ears, even harder is keeping them in your ears"
7563,3.0, I bought them to use on the treadmill and listen to my ipad while cooking
7564,3.0," Exercising with them is frustrating, with the sweaty moisture that goes with exercise, the airpods fall out of your ears and I am going back to the traditional ear buds"
7565,5.0,"I have been wanting a pair of AirPods for a minute but I just didn’t have the funds to get them, so I saved up some money and FINALLY got them"
7566,5.0," But of course, I wanted to check if there was a cheaper and easier way to buy them as the closest Apple store is an hour away from me and lo and behold I saw these beauties for $30 cheaper than they are on the Apple store"
7567,5.0," I waited a dreadfully long 3 days for them to come and oh my god, I was on top of the moon when I saw they were delivered"
7568,5.0, Now before I ordered them I was very skeptical as some people were saying they were fakes and they broke on them as soon as they opened their Airpods
7569,5.0," I don’t know what their reviews were about lol, but mines are brand new"
7570,5.0, Sealed and brand new package with brand new Airpods
7571,5.0, Connecting them was a breeze and the sound quality is much better compared to the regular ear pods Apple has that comes with the phones
7572,5.0," I’m in love and I am here to assure you, even though my review will probably get lost in the mix, that these are the real things and I am very satisfied with my purchase"
7573,1.0,"Ok, this is my second review after Amazon deleted my first one"
7574,1.0, In their email they claimed it was authentic and it was not fake
7575,1.0, If it was authentic why Apple website didn’t recognize it when I entered the S/N to verify its authenticity
7576,5.0,The sound quality is good
7577,5.0, But the battery life and the charging capability is absolutely amazing
7578,5.0, They are just perfect
7579,5.0," No wires bothering you, they stay in good"
7580,5.0, Someone ask you a question you take one out it pauses the music
7581,5.0, Take them out put them in the case and in 15 minutes you have fresh head phones
7582,5.0, I haven’t charged the case in over a week and I’m still going strong
7583,5.0, The way they are engineered is truly amazing
7584,5.0,Great sound in a tiny comfortable size
7585,5.0, To get any better sound quality you would have to go to full size Bose or Beats
7586,5.0, I am a musician and truly appreciate the sound quality given the convenience of size and price point
7587,5.0," The noise cancellation is not the quality of large headphones but in every other sense, these are great"
7588,5.0," Also great ease of BT connection; just put them in your ears and they connect, no buttons needed"
7589,5.0, Great mic for phone calls and the battery life is amazing
7590,5.0," I use them for hours, just plug case in at night and pods stay charged at all times"
7591,3.0,"Sound is excellent for listening to music, watching shows online, and talking on the phone"
7592,3.0," I think the mic is very good, too"
7593,3.0, But I had these on for an hour and had to remove them twice because they hurt my ears
7594,3.0," I want to return them and get the pros, which my husband has; the pro are much more comfortable — and they have noise cancellation"
7595,3.0, But they’re almost double the price
7596,3.0, :(
7597,4.0,I bought these because I had trouble keeping similar wireless headphones in my ears while walking or exercising
7598,4.0," Other wired or wireless headsets with interchangeable, difference sized soft ear pieces never fit right and had a tendency to come loose or slip out entirely"
7599,4.0, Very annoying at the gym in the middle of a class or on the treadmill
7600,4.0, These are so light and hang on the ear that you don't notice they are there
7601,4.0,Frankly I don't use them on an 'i' device but on an Android phone
7602,4.0, That shouldn't matter
7603,4.0, The only negative is that every once in a while they seem to go out of sync
7604,4.0, This causes an echo effect
7605,4.0, It becomes difficult to understand spoken word because of the echo
7606,4.0," The only way I have found to fix it is to go to Bluetooth settings, disconnect, then reconnect the AirPoids"
7607,4.0, That means I have to stop my exercise program to restart them
7608,4.0, Very annoying
7609,4.0, The connected device used shouldn't matter if the Bluetooth is compatible
7610,5.0,I initially bought Samsung earbuds because they were highest rated
7611,5.0," I found them to be uncomfortable and more expensive, so I returned them and purchased the earbuds"
7612,5.0," They work well, except sometimes people say they cannot hear me"
7613,5.0," I like the fit, and the convenience of not having any wires"
7614,5.0, They’re the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever had
7615,5.0,These AirPods arrived in perfect condition
7616,5.0," New, sealed box with instructions, charging cable, charging case, and of course, the AirPods"
7617,5.0, I don’t know why the other reviews are a mixed bag of poor to terrible so far as the product is concerned
7618,5.0, You can tell from my pictures that there is absolutely nothing wrong with them
7619,5.0," I don’t think these are intended for noise canceling, so I rated them a 3 in that area"
7620,5.0," Otherwise, 5 stars"
7621,5.0," The AirPods and charging case arrived more than 75% charged, too"
7622,5.0, Ready to go right out of the box
7623,5.0, Love them
7624,1.0,These airpods are 1st generation
7625,1.0, It’s obvious as soon as you open the box
7626,1.0, The light that indicates if it’s charging is on the inside of the case rather than on the outside of the case
7627,1.0, I’m very disappointed but I’ve already opened it so I don’t think I can return them
7628,1.0, If you’re looking for Apple products just go directly to the Apple site
7629,5.0,"AirPods came as expected, nothing unusual"
7630,5.0," If you’re trying to decide if you need to get the wireless case, I would say just go for the wired case"
7631,5.0, It charges so fast it isn’t even a problem
7632,5.0," When your AirPods die, the case has charge in it as well, so in a way, it is like having wireless charging"
7633,5.0," As long as the case is charged, you can put your AirPods in without having to plug into the wall and it charges"
7634,5.0,These AirPods don’t fit in my ears like the apple ear pods
7635,5.0," They’re a little looser and don’t go as far into my ears, I’ve noticed"
7636,5.0, I’ve gotten use to it and I just turn the volume up a little
7637,5.0,The best thing about these headphones isn’t the sound quality
7638,5.0, For me it’s just the user experience
7639,5.0, It automatically connects to the apple device I’m using and the battery percentage shows
7640,5.0, Pop an AirPod out and whatever you’re watching or listening to pauses
7641,5.0, Can tap on the AirPod to answer a call
7642,5.0, I bought them for convenience
7643,5.0,Got these as a Christmas gift for my wife
7644,5.0," She has recently started using an exercise bike and with the new Apple Health + option, I got these so that she could listen to the workouts while riding in comfort"
7645,5.0," The noise cancellation on these is really good as well, doesn't block out all noise, but you can melt away while using them"
7646,5.0, She has used them almost daily since she got them for Christmas and is in love with them
7647,5.0,Just received my new pair
7648,5.0, I had a pair of AirPods but unfortunately left them in my pants pocket
7649,5.0,and they went through a wash cycle
7650,5.0, So I went on amazon to see about buying a new pair
7651,5.0, My old pair was free (since I got a new iPad through Apple) but this pair was $136 with tax
7652,5.0, I was definitely hesitant to buy these from amazon because of some of the reviews but I’m here to say these are AWESOME
7653,5.0, They are legit Apple AirPods and they’re cheaper on amazon
7654,5.0, The one on the left is my old pair and the new ones are on the right
7655,5.0, There is no difference
7656,5.0," Take it from me, you won’t regret it"
7657,5.0, Just make sure to check your pockets ALWAYS
7658,5.0, They are not water proof and the advice Apple gave me did not work for the old ones (leave it out for 24 hours)
7659,5.0," Good investment if you listen to music a lot, make calls, like the convenience of no cords"
7660,5.0, Just be careful because it’s a lot of money to lose if you have no AppleCare
7661,5.0, Even with AppleCare there are still fees to replace them
7662,5.0,"I’d gone through many different types and models of ear buds, and was never happy with any of them"
7663,5.0, My wife got these for Christmas and they’re astounding
7664,5.0, I’ll never go back to the ones with wires attaching the two ear buds
7665,5.0, Theses are sensational
7666,5.0, Crystal clear audio
7667,5.0," The music is like listening to a high end sound system with each instrument audible at any volume and the battery set up with charging in the case while you’re not near a plug to charge is an added feature that cannot be overstated as being very, very cool"
7668,5.0, Highly recommend these earbuds
7669,3.0,"if you will only use these with Apple devices, you will probably be completely thrilled"
7670,3.0," But if you are connecting to, say, a Sony TV, there are challenges"
7671,3.0, You can't adjust the volume of the earphones
7672,3.0," And if you switch between devices, you have to ""connect"" again on the device"
7673,3.0," Again, I think if you were all Apple ios, these issues would arise and you would be 100% happy"
7674,5.0,My son loves these because he can charge his phone and listen to music at the same time
7675,5.0, His friends gently teased him about having wired headphones
7676,5.0, His is happy about the way they fit and the sound is great
7677,5.0, This was a good purchase because I was able to save a few dollars
7678,5.0, It was a good Christmas gift
7679,5.0, You have to keep up with technology and of course that comes at a cost
7680,5.0, It was a good purchase
7681,5.0,I hesitated to buy AirPods for a long time because I thought they were quite pricey but when the good deal came available I decided to finally get them
7682,5.0, I’m very glad I did as the sound quality is great and they’re so comfortable to wear
7683,5.0, I really like how easily they pair with all my Apple devices
7684,5.0," All in all, I’m very happy with my purchase"
7685,5.0,Airpods:
7686,5.0,"Now, normally I dont use Apple products besides my iPad pro (2018) and Apple pencil 2nd Gen for drawing"
7687,5.0,"But I was seeking some sleek, good sounding earbuds that would go well with my iPad"
7688,5.0," Back when I got my iPad, Airpods were way too much for me"
7689,5.0," But throughout the years, they have fallen in price"
7690,5.0, So I decided to buy them here
7691,5.0, They were only $115
7692,5.0," That, I thought was a steal"
7693,5.0," I ordered em up, quick"
7694,5.0, Came just in time
7695,5.0, Very quick delivery as well
7696,5.0,"I've been using them with my android phone (one plus 6T, or Oneplus 8"
7697,5.0,) Since I dont own an iPhone and don't desire one as of now
7698,5.0," I love customization, custom ROMs, and such"
7699,5.0,"I have also used them with my iPad, and I must say, the tech is so fast to pair"
7700,5.0," They sound great, and they look great"
7701,5.0,"Anyone who has an android phone that were considering getting these, I recommend them, wholely"
7702,5.0,Picture taken by me with Google Camera mod
7703,5.0,It's a set of Apple Air Pods
7704,5.0," If you don't think they are the greatest thing ever, then you obviously hate democracy and eat babies"
7705,5.0, Or at least that's what my wife told me - these were a gift to her
7706,5.0," I have no use for Apple's overpriced, locked-down stuff"
7707,5.0," Wife says these work well, sound great, no issues"
7708,5.0," So, you know, there you go"
7709,4.0,I don’t think the sound quality of the AirPods provide much competition to actual over ear headphones
7710,4.0," However, I do think they make up for it with all the convenience they’ve packed into these little earbuds"
7711,4.0," The AirPods are quick to connect to the last device you’ve used them with, and they have pretty good range on them"
7712,4.0, I’m able to walk around the office while listening to Spotify without any interruptions
7713,4.0," When I’m not listening to anything, I happily place them back in the charging case the AirPods come with"
7714,4.0, I also would like to point out how great it is to be able to charge your AirPods on the go since the charger case is small enough to fit in your pocket
7715,4.0," I’ve used these buds at the gym, in a busy train, and while walking through the bustling streets of Chicago during rush hour without any complaints for sound or noise cancelling"
7716,4.0," As I’ve mentioned earlier, they won’t perform better than actual premium over the ear headphones in terms of sound and noise cancellation, but they still perform very well given what’s provided and these small little ear buds"
7717,4.0," I would certainly buy these again, and would completely recommend them to anyone who is curious"
7718,2.0,"the sound SOUNDS okay, but it's so quiet"
7719,2.0, there's no noise cancelation at all
7720,2.0, that shouldn't even be a category
7721,2.0, the battery life started good and has been rapidly decreasing
7722,2.0, sometimes they wont link to my phone
7723,2.0, sometimes they randomly disconnect
7724,2.0, if I turn the volume down for a second when I turn it back up the volume is still quiet until I put them back in the case for a minute
7725,2.0, then the volume bar is still all the way down but when I turn it up again it gets louder
7726,2.0, same thing if you turn it up accidentally and try to turn it down
7727,2.0," I've only had them for 6 months, and I don't even use them that much"
7728,2.0, I had a better experience with 30$ Bluetooth earbuds from home depot
7729,2.0,"These AirPods have good sound and worked reliably until 2 days ago, less than 2 months after purchased, when they stopped pairing properly, and alternately had sound only from the left, then the right"
7730,2.0,Messaging contact with Apple Tech Support was an exercise in frustration
7731,2.0," An agent who must have been handling several other calls took an hour and a half to walk us through a procedure that should have taken five minutes, finally arriving at the obvious conclusion that there was a problem"
7732,2.0," Then the fun began, eventually preparing to send them back for evaluation, for which I was told at the last minute that they wanted a credit card deposit for more than I paid for them"
7733,2.0," The support agent claimed that although the 1-year limited warranty applied to battery issues, it did not apply to connectivity issues"
7734,2.0, Doesn't sound right
7735,2.0,"Surely, Apple could do better than this"
7736,2.0, At this point I decided to check on Amazon's return policy and discovered that we are still within the time window for return/replacement
7737,2.0, So that's what we'll do
7738,2.0,"I've bought lots of Apple products and have been generally satisfied, but maybe I'll be less stuck on the brand in the future"
7739,5.0,Best purchase of Black Friday 2021
7740,5.0," You don’t need the latest version of AirPods, these will do just fine"
7741,5.0, They have a great battery life
7742,5.0, The structure could be slightly better because they do tend to fall out sometimes but no big deal
7743,5.0," Buy it, you won’t regret it"
7744,5.0,"Okay, I am an Apple fan, have been for a while"
7745,5.0, I love this second-gen over the 3rd gen
7746,5.0, they fit and feel better in my opinion
7747,5.0, there was only one difference that happened to catch me off guard
7748,5.0, There is no indicator light on the front of this set
7749,5.0," That is not a problem, but it was a slight difference between my 1st set and this set"
7750,5.0, They are still my go-to most of the time
7751,5.0," (Drag queen streamers delight, wigs and crowns are not a problem with these)"
7752,4.0,These are good AirPods
7753,4.0," Unfortunately, they hurt my ears"
7754,4.0, I have bought a total of three of these AirPods
7755,4.0," One for my daughter, one for my boyfriend, and one for me"
7756,4.0," They do not hurt my boyfriend or daughter’s ears, so it may just be me"
7757,4.0, I do have smaller ears and may be the reason they hurt me
7758,4.0,The sound is amazing
7759,4.0," If you are looking for good soundproof earbuds, these are not for you"
7760,4.0,I had to buy the AirPods Pro for the extra comfort
7761,4.0, The AirPods Pro’s have both amazing sound and soundproof
7762,4.0,"These are real AirPods, for those who doubt their legitimacy"
7763,1.0,These AirPods are EXTREMELY flawed
7764,1.0, This is the second pair of second generation AirPods I bought where the microphone completely stopped working
7765,1.0, I now have two pairs of AirPods that do not have a working microphone and I need them to talk with for my work
7766,1.0, Incredibly disappointed with Apple and this crappy AirPods
7767,1.0,I just bought the third generation and let’s see if those last longer than six months
7768,1.0,First of all it was okay once I received but it kept falling out from my ear
7769,1.0, No worries
7770,1.0, The following day I lost one ear piece
7771,1.0, Oh well I figured I have one to use and listen to music or something
7772,1.0, Not really
7773,1.0, Couple of days later entirely stopped working and I had to order a new one
7774,1.0, Money well spent for a $120 ear phones
7775,1.0, Perfect
7776,4.0,"The AirPods are about what you would expect from Apple - spendy, clever, and extremely functional"
7777,4.0," Sturdy, comfortable, and convenient wireless abilities allow alot of movement whether working out, skating, or mowing the lawn"
7778,4.0, They have never fallen out of my ears
7779,4.0," While there is no real noise cancellation function (or, at least not that I have noticed), and sound quality is pretty good"
7780,4.0," Where this product really shines, is in the battery charge/recharge ability"
7781,4.0,After a year: These are still awesome
7782,4.0, There has not been a noticeable decline in charge
7783,4.0, They still last about 2 hours between charges
7784,4.0, The case only has to be charged about every two days
7785,4.0,"Having tried the air-pod pros, I think these are still more comfortable"
7786,4.0,Sound quality is still good to excellent
7787,4.0,Mic quality is pretty good
7788,4.0,Only real drawback is the case has a tendency to collect lint and stuff in the cracks and edges from being in your pocket
7789,4.0,Totally still recommend
7790,5.0,I bought these airpods a few months ago just because they had the best price on the market
7791,5.0, They arrived as brand new airpods in an apple box
7792,5.0, They are made in California but assembled in Vietnam not China
7793,5.0, The only thing that apple could have improved would've been the battery life
7794,5.0, These are the second generation of the apple airpods
7795,4.0,These headphones aren't too bad
7796,4.0, To me the quality is somewhat better than the free headphones you get with your iPhone
7797,4.0, They don't do much to block out sound but that's OK with me
7798,4.0, I have my Jabra wireless headphones for that
7799,4.0, The sound quality is good but not as good as others
7800,4.0, Connecting to your iPhone is fast
7801,4.0,when it connects
7802,4.0," When using them to talk on the phone, the other party says I sound fine and I can hear them well so that's a plus"
7803,4.0, I find it difficult to have a conversation using headphones that totally block out outside noise
7804,4.0, I feel like I sound plugged up but I don't have that sensation with the AirPods
7805,4.0,"They are a great buy sound quality is superb battery life is excellent bluetooth connection stays strong and is easy to connect, My only problem with them is how they fit in your ear it can be uncomfortable at times especially when laying down but the more important issue I made this review to discuss is that because of the way these fit in your ear they get ear wax stuck in them very very easily and quickly, because of this you can start to loose your sound quality within 30 days the airpods are not broken and this is not a mechanical issue its just the wax is blocking the holes were the sound comes out of so you cant hear the sound it is also a relatively difficult process to clean them without looking at a tutorial on youtube or somewhere else because of this issue I gave the Airpods 4 stars"
7806,4.0, thanks for reading
7807,5.0,The set up was fairly easy so far I am enjoying the wireless feature
7808,5.0, I got tired of cords and headphones dying on me way to quickly
7809,5.0," They are fairly secure in your ears once on, not too easy to fall off"
7810,5.0, Its worth it to invest in a better pair of headphones that should last
7811,5.0, I did have any issues connecting with the blue tooth connectivity
7812,5.0, I'm very happy with my purchase so far
7813,5.0, I haven't tested the battery life yet though
7814,5.0, So its a 5 for now
7815,5.0,So many debate the price and sound quality
7816,5.0, I'm not going to do that
7817,5.0, I know if that is all you care about you can find better
7818,5.0," If you own multiple Apple Devices, it's the way to go"
7819,5.0," I have a MacBook, Ipad, Apple watch, and Iphone"
7820,5.0, It switches so easy between them
7821,5.0, I use wifi calling a lot and can use any device to do this even when I forget my phone somewhere else
7822,5.0, That is why the easy device switching is important to me and it is faster than previous generation
7823,1.0,When I receive them open the box they came just like this looks like they’ve been used and they were broken so only 1 worked didn’t really get to try them out very disappointed
7824,2.0,"Even though I’m sure to keep my AirPods clean, after a year, so much earwax has been jammed into the AirPods that audio is significantly quieter"
7825,2.0, Not worth the money
7826,2.0, No noise cancellation which is pretty standard at the end of 2021
7827,2.0, Battery is great
7828,2.0, The AirPods last for a long time but the case starts to deplete faster as you use them
7829,2.0, The microphone is horrible
7830,2.0," If I had a dollar for everytime I was told I couldn’t be heard, I would probably have AirPods Pro’s anyway"
7831,2.0, I feel there are better options than these
7832,2.0," If you want to spend some extra money, the AirPods Pro’s are a good choice"
7833,2.0," Silicone tips (which would prevent the earwax issue), great noise cancellation, better microphones, recent"
7834,2.0," Conclusion is, they’re great for about a year but unless you don’t produce earwax, they start to get quieter"
7835,4.0,"I really like over the head, noise canceling headphones, but it gets pretty hot over the summer in LA, so I can't wear them as often as I would like"
7836,4.0, I decided to try the AirPods after several recommendations from my friends
7837,4.0," It doesn't cancel external noise, but they feel weightless and they are incredibly easy to set up"
7838,4.0, The battery lasts a decent amount of time and the charging case is small enough that you can keep it in your pocket
7839,4.0, They fit really well
7840,4.0," They don't reproduce low frequencies as well as over the head headphones, but they don't sound bad at all"
7841,4.0, A great buy for non-audiophiles
7842,5.0,I love my AirPods so far
7843,5.0, I have only had them for a few days but they have been great for listening to music
7844,5.0, The sound quality is amazing and I have had no problems with connecting to my iPhone XS
7845,5.0," They connect as soon as I put them in my ears, which is very convenient"
7846,5.0, They connected right away to my iPad with no problem as well
7847,5.0, Battery life is excellent
7848,5.0, No issues with that after hours of listening to music
7849,5.0, So far I love them and am very happy with my purchase
7850,5.0,Had Gen 1 and used them everyday for 4 years
7851,5.0, Picked up these
7852,5.0, Same function just as good
7853,4.0,"I really like them, and I think they live up to the hype"
7854,4.0, I love being able to keep my phone in my bedroom and still being able to go to the bathroom while still hearing my music
7855,4.0," The battery life is really long, longer than I thought"
7856,4.0, The case is small and sleek and the AirPods are also small and look good
7857,4.0," They may not work for every ear type, as it fell out of my small ears for a while before I got used to them"
7858,4.0, Pretty easy to connect to my iPhone and they sound nice
7859,4.0, I love the features where it stops when you take one out
7860,5.0,I love love love these
7861,5.0, Was hesitant to purchase because of price
7862,5.0, Wasted $30 on cheaper version and they lose connection a lot and have to turn phone off and on to re connect
7863,5.0, These have performed flawlessly
7864,5.0, Can set tap control to preference
7865,5.0, I det my right to play/pause and left to skip
7866,5.0, Excellent
7867,2.0,Not as great as I hoped they'd be
7868,2.0,"Upon buying them, you'll have three more things to keep charged all the time"
7869,2.0,Supporting software makes it difficult to know precisely how much charge is in either of the three devices (two air pods -- and the charging case)
7870,2.0,You'll also be constantly worried about losing them
7871,2.0," When you do, Apple will make you pay for the replacement"
7872,2.0," not cheap, either"
7873,2.0,"It's hard to wear them for a long period of time -- they start to hurt your ears after a while, as they are only made of hard plastic"
7874,5.0,I love the 2nd generation AirPods
7875,5.0,"prior to purchasing them (to gift them to myself for Christmas), I used my wife's"
7876,5.0,I also asked the young members of my staff for their opinion of the newer-generation AirPods; who unanimously endorsed the 2nd generation over the 3rd and 3rd (pro) generations
7877,5.0,"sometimes, the newest is not necessarily the best"
7878,5.0,This is like my third purchase of the air pods 2
7879,5.0, I end up giving them to my kids and then buying another pair for myself
7880,5.0," I’m not sure why, but these things seem to sound a lot better than my air pod pros"
7881,5.0," The bass is much deeper, producing a sound I appreciate a lot more"
7882,5.0," Weird, cuz I always hear the critics complaining about the opposite"
7883,5.0, Lucky me I guess
7884,4.0,My sister asked me to order these for her
7885,4.0, She seems to like them quite a bit as when she’s home she appears to always have them in
7886,4.0," The sound quality is good, and the battery life appears to be good as well"
7887,4.0, Not sure about the noise cancellation feature so cannot comment on that
7888,4.0,"They didn’t arrive the first time it was “supposedly shipped”, so I had to get a replacement which arrived on the expected date"
7889,4.0, Thanks
7890,4.0,Loveeee
7891,4.0,"Update: about 3 days later I notice a spot on the back of the AirPods case that looks as if the paint has rubbed off but was repainted with a darker color (see photo, right above thumb), I hadn’t noticed this until yesterday"
7892,4.0, I’m starting to question if they are the real Apple AirPods because of the other reviews
7893,4.0," They work well, but they are cheaper than the ones on the apple website and I want to know why"
7894,1.0,The left AirPod for these won't connect to the charger
7895,1.0, We contacted Apple and they said we had to contact Amazon for them to honor the warranty
7896,1.0, I contacted the Warranty Questions team and they will NOT reply
7897,1.0, Our year warranty date is approaching and this is incredibly frustrating they won't reply and get this taken care of
7898,5.0,I was super hesitant to buy AirPods
7899,5.0, I thought they were aesthetically I’m appealing they reminded me of Qtips
7900,5.0, But I ended up actually really loving these
7901,5.0, They charge super fast and they aren’t IN my ear
7902,5.0, Once you open the case they were automatically connected to my phone
7903,5.0, I didn’t have to do any setup
7904,5.0, The cons are they are not noise cancelling and you have to take them out to talk to someone unless you can hear through them
7905,5.0, My bf says they fall out a lot
7906,5.0, I think everyone’s ear anatomy is just different
7907,5.0, I had The Jabra elite active 65t and I didn’t like stuffing them into my ear every time and they’d fall out
7908,5.0," Yes, they were noise cancelling and had this cool hear through function but they wouldn’t stay in, especially my left ear"
7909,5.0,If you buy these make sure when you buy it says sold and shipped by Amazon
7910,5.0, Do not buy from other sellers because you will get fake AirPods
7911,5.0, If you buy from Amazon you will get authentic AirPods for less than you would buy at Apple stores
7912,5.0, These have great sound and great battery life
7913,5.0," Of course, the more you use them the quicker the battery life would diminish"
7914,5.0, These are great if you iPhone 7 or greater because there is no earphone/headphone jack and can make it so that you can listen and charge at the same time
7915,5.0, A main reason I got this
7916,3.0,I expected to be jumping for joy when I put these pods in my ears
7917,3.0," The sound is fine, not superior to my wired ones"
7918,3.0, I tried to adjust volume by asking Siri to lower the volume and her reply was it’s already high
7919,3.0, Tres confusez
7920,3.0,I’m hoping minor headaches are not a permanent part of the joy of using them
7921,3.0,I’ll update when things change
7922,2.0,I thought I grabbed a good deal but it was too good to be true
7923,2.0,"At first when I would take the right AirPod out of the case & it would pop up on my notifications, it would glitch as if was unsure if I took it out or not"
7924,2.0, & an update was giving hoping it would fix the issue but it did not
7925,2.0,I ended up putting both headphones on and it sounded like a bad stereo
7926,2.0, The music wasn’t synced
7927,2.0, It was just a hot mess
7928,2.0, Returning
7929,4.0,"It’s been about three months since I’ve been using my AirPods and aside from memeing with them on the daily, I’ve enjoyed them a great deal"
7930,4.0, They work really well; the mic transmits my voice well when I call and the sound quality as well as latency is basically the same as using good quality wired earbuds (but much more comfortable in my opinion)
7931,4.0, They don’t fall out btw
7932,4.0, One thing I’ve noticed is that the case and AirPods are prone to getting weird dirt particles attached to them (like fibers from my pockets end up in the case) and stains are a pain to clean
7933,4.0, They are white after all soooo makes sense
7934,4.0,Although the sound quality is really good; around this time I’ve started experiencing weird disconnects and lag
7935,4.0, Like the signal is getting disrupted but it only really happens when I’m on break at work
7936,4.0, At home or when I’m out and about nothing really happens except for a long delay before they sync with my phone
7937,4.0, Battery life seems okay; but I think it’s bothersome how I basically have to always leave the case and pods on a charger or they die when they’re not in use
7938,4.0," The case I kind of get, but I don’t know why the pods get drained when they’re not connected/playing"
7939,4.0, Overall I’m satisfied with my purchase; the slight cons don’t really change much for me since I mainly use them when I’m making commutes from home to work or from my room to the bathroom
7940,4.0, If you’re an apple person or you wanna buy them just so you can be like “sorry; i didn’t catch that
7941,4.0, airpods
7942,4.0,” Then go for it
7943,4.0, Pop off
7944,3.0,"The best thing about these earbuds is how easy they are to use, specifically how they automatically connect to and switch between the devices you’re using"
7945,3.0, Can seamlessly switch from iPhone to laptop to iPad
7946,3.0,The shortcomings of these earbuds include:
7947,3.0,1
7948,3.0," Although the tap controls are customizable, there are some key functions that are missing"
7949,3.0, Mute/unmute is the most obvious missing function
7950,3.0,2
7951,3.0," The sound is good, but far from great"
7952,3.0,3
7953,3.0," The charging case is very slippery, making it very likely that it will slip out of your pocket"
7954,3.0, I lost my first pair of these because the case slipped out of my gym shorts pocket when I sat down
7955,5.0,"I considered buying the new Air Pod Pros but when I saw that I could get 2 pairs of these for the price of 1 Pro, I ended up doing just that by buying a pair for my wife and I"
7956,5.0," While I am sure the noise cancellation feature in the Pros is great, these work perfectly well for our needs, and particularly good and handy for talking on the phone"
7957,5.0," My wife and I also used them on a plane and while we could definitely hear engine noise, we were both happy with the sound/quality and even more happy with the price"
7958,5.0,"I have had AirPods since day one, after 4 years the battery went dead"
7959,5.0, 4 years so that speaks for the value and the endurance of the product
7960,5.0, On top of that Amazon comes in at the absolute lowest price you can find 
7961,5.0, Buy them and I promise you will not regret the purchase
7962,5.0,"Amazon is the the place you want to purchase this product, you will not find a better price or product guarantee"
7963,5.0,"I use it predominantly playing golf, which does stress the limits of the device"
7964,5.0," If I move too far from the iPhone it’s linked too, it’ll cut in and out, or off entirely"
7965,5.0," It’s not a fair criticism, but it’s my particular use"
7966,5.0," It’s also odd, when at a distance, the music will tune in and out depending on the position of my head while putting"
7967,5.0," Again, most people won’t care, but if Apple can improve this, it’ll probably help in other situations"
7968,5.0, Great sound otherwise and the earbuds are very comfortable over long usage spans
7969,5.0,It took me a long time to buy into these wireless earphones
7970,5.0, I had another pair and quite frankly the pairing to the Bluetooth was terrible sound quality wasn’t great and the battery was awful
7971,5.0, I finally broke down and bought these and could not be more impressed
7972,5.0, The sound quality is great and the battery life is amazing
7973,5.0,I got these for my daughter for Christmas
7974,5.0," I really wanted to spend less and buy another brand, but"
7975,5.0,you know
7976,5.0," She wanted the ""real deal"
7977,5.0,""" She LOVES them"
7978,5.0, I tried them on and couldn't believe the sound quality
7979,5.0," Two of the best features: You can charge the case, she can charge her pods on that case"
7980,5.0," Also, she has found a way to track them if she can't find them"
7981,5.0, I'm glad I paid the extra for these - the extra price was worth it
7982,5.0, She wears them a lot
7983,2.0,I loved them
7984,2.0, So much
7985,2.0, So in love like the honeymoon phase
7986,2.0, Then almost 7 months in the left earbud barely has sound
7987,2.0, The sound is so low like a whisper
7988,2.0, I’m so sad
7989,2.0, I spent so much on these babies I should have bought the fricken warranty
7990,2.0, I’m so annoyed 😒 just my luck I would get the dummy ones that only last not even 7 months
7991,5.0,Simply a nice upgrade to what I had purchased before
7992,5.0, What a difference an apple product makes
7993,5.0," OK, so here's the choice: Charging case with a cable or via wifi"
7994,5.0, Needless money spent there
7995,5.0," I just plug the little case in, no issues there and just 1-2 times per week"
7996,5.0," These are the first generation and for my ears, they are fine, they fit"
7997,5.0, I am very happy with NOT spending more and getting such a quality earphone
7998,5.0," They have worked fine for zoom meetings, walking conversations, and for watching movies at home from my ipad"
7999,5.0, They easily pop up on your bluetooth screen for whatever device you are using
8000,5.0," Just choose ""studio earpods"" on your screen and they will begin"
8001,5.0,I had AirPods 2 years ago gifted from friend
8002,5.0, I love the wireless & battery life
8003,5.0, The sound quality & removing one ear to stop it from playing
8004,5.0,I just don’t like any other wireless earphones
8005,5.0, My AirPods gave out they been through a lot the past 3 years
8006,5.0," One ear stopped working , I saw this on sale & purchased it last night got it this Morning"
8007,5.0, Love it
8008,5.0, Also I got the warranty doesn’t hurt to have protection if one ear fails
8009,5.0,I originally purchased the Apple AirPod Pro's or whatever the noise cancelling version of these is but I didn't like the fit of those at all
8010,5.0, I really like the way the Apple AirPods fit in my ear and they are so light I can hardly tell they are there but they fit snuggly so it would take a lot to dislodge them
8011,5.0, Just be careful taking off a sweatshirt or shirt as they will fall out
8012,5.0,These Apple airpods were a Christmas gift for my teenage granddaughter and she told me they are totally awesome
8013,5.0," She uses them all the time, and the noise cancelling feature cancels the family voices right out"
8014,5.0, We now have to make monkey motions or stand on our heads to get her attention
8015,5.0," Oh, and the battery life is great"
8016,2.0,This is my second pair after losing the first
8017,2.0, Why for the love of god do we keep buying this product after losing them easily and they stop working so quickly
8018,2.0, I can’t tell you how many troubleshooting videos I’ve watched for these things
8019,2.0, I’m moving on
8020,2.0," Apple - be better, your quality has absolutely tanked over the years"
8021,5.0,For ear buds they're great
8022,5.0," I don't know if it's Apple Music or Airpods but some of the music I've been listening to for years sound a little different, they're much clearer and the mix is a little different, in a good way"
8023,5.0, It's like listening to them for the first time
8024,5.0, Heads up though: you can't use the airpods as a microphone if you want to use it to make videos or speak into your voice recorder
8025,5.0, They won't work
8026,5.0,I bough Airpods 3 from Apple directly and returned within a few days
8027,5.0, I was hoping to upgrade from Airpods 2 but they had a terrible fit
8028,5.0," Airpods 2 have a great fit, good battery life"
8029,5.0, The sound is okay not that great for music compared to Airpods 3
8030,5.0, But the fit to me is more important
8031,5.0, Airpods 3 causes ear pain and falls off from ear compared to 2
8032,3.0,The AirPods them themselves are gen 2 but the AirPods case in gen 1
8033,3.0, To be honest I regret buying them from here I should have bought them from the apple store
8034,3.0, I know this b/c the light is on the inside and not outside of the case
8035,3.0, Also the serial number if you search up the serial number on the case it shows up airpods gen 1
8036,3.0,but for the AirPods themselves it shows gen 2
8037,3.0, Like I just wanna know why would anyone do this especially Amazon
8038,3.0, This is a crazy scam to be honest
8039,5.0,Great experience
8040,5.0," Second pair, as the first ever pair I had got destroyed by my washing machine"
8041,5.0, oops
8042,5.0," Overall great headphones, they're real yes"
8043,5.0," Sound great, I wear them at the gym and while working (office work) and the battery life has never been a problem for me"
8044,5.0," I workout for about 2 hours and they aren't close to dying, and then I put them in the case and I'm good"
8045,5.0, Got them on sale for about $100 so it was a good deal
8046,2.0,Opened it for the first time and Bluetooth’d to my daughters phone and it says “daddy’s AirPods”
8047,2.0,These were told they would be new
8048,2.0, they obviously aren’t
8049,5.0,"I have the Samsung Galaxy S9, and these pair well with the phone"
8050,5.0," Definitely NOT noise cancelling which is fine (for use at work, or wherever it is important for me to hear ambient noise)"
8051,5.0," However, I use my Bose Soundsport wireless for the gym and other places where I want noise cancellation"
8052,5.0,"The airpods are not snug in my ear, but so far they have not fallen out - though I am hesitant to wear them jogging"
8053,5.0, The Bose are better for that
8054,5.0," Overall, a very good product"
8055,5.0,"First, I bought “cheaper” brands because I didn’t want to spend $100+ dollars for headphones"
8056,5.0, However-I needed up spending MORE because the Cheap Ones didn’t Work
8057,5.0," So, Finally just ordered these"
8058,5.0," WOW, What a Difference"
8059,5.0, LOVE that they turn on IMMEDIATELY when u place into your ears
8060,5.0, Sound quality awesome
8061,5.0, Battery life not as long as I’d like~so I bought 2
8062,5.0, Now I ALWAYS have a fresh pair to use
8063,5.0, I should have bought these FIRST and been done with the Hassles
8064,5.0, Don’t make same mistake I did
8065,1.0,At the beginning the AirPods were great
8066,1.0, But after 3 weeks the sound got lower and lower
8067,1.0, If I have my phone on medium volumen I can’t hear anything
8068,1.0, I have to have them on high volume to be able to hear the music
8069,1.0, At the beginning it wasn’t like that
8070,1.0, And I have tried other headphones and the other headphones work just fine with my phone
8071,1.0, So I’m sure it’s the AirPods
8072,1.0, I will try to go to the Apple store to see if they can fix them
8073,5.0,I think they're great
8074,5.0, I've tried a couple of others trying to save money
8075,5.0, My main purpose is to use them for phone calls
8076,5.0, People that I spoke to with other cheaper models by other manufactures allowed me to hear ok but callers on the other end said the quality was terrible
8077,5.0," With these, people on the other end say that the quality is perfect"
8078,5.0, They're great with music too
8079,1.0,"this set of airpods has never given more than 45 minutes of battery time and now, just over a year of use and I am getting only 20 minutes"
8080,1.0, I find that unacceptable
8081,1.0,short
8082,5.0,"Very good earbuds, I’m very picking about earbuds since some hurt my ears but I’m able to wear these for hours and forget that I am even wearing them"
8083,5.0, One problem is that when I first got them they wouldn’t charge and they would randomly disconnect and randomly connect for no reason
8084,5.0, Hasn’t happened in 2 years but it was a problem that is still happening to people that buy these AirPods
8085,5.0, Still highly recommend them
8086,2.0,Plumber by trade
8087,2.0, Would not recommend if you work manual labor
8088,2.0," Thought Apple made good products, but I would recommend getting the cheaper type earbuds"
8089,2.0, These didn’t last me 4 months
8090,2.0," Volume just gets lower and lower with each week of use, mic is not working as good either"
8091,2.0, Tried to keep them clean every day but I can’t stand the fact that I can no longer hear anything add more than what seems to be 25% volume
8092,2.0, Pretty disappointing an apple
8093,2.0, Love my phone though
8094,1.0,"First, they don’t stay in my ears"
8095,1.0," Second, the case looks like dental floss"
8096,1.0," Third, the battery life sucks"
8097,1.0, Fourth - and the BUYER BEWARE - is the left AirPod stopped working after 1 month
8098,1.0, Google “left AirPod not working” it’s been a chronic problem for YEARS
8099,1.0," So far none of the fixes have worked - resetting, restarting device, etc"
8100,1.0, Fifth
8101,1.0," The phone says both L and R are charged 100%, but the iPhone podcast app says the left is 5% charged"
8102,1.0, Don’t recommend
8103,1.0, Regret the purchase
8104,1.0," If Apple remedies the problem, I’ll revise the review"
8105,1.0, They’d be great - if they worked
8106,1.0, Disappointing
8107,5.0,"Worked for a while, now when using the dictation it puts words I am not saying anywhere near, the battery life is the worst and it will answer calls with the slights of sounds resulting in 12 unwanted phone calls at difficult times (a screaming melt down of a 3 year old figuring out boundaries isn’t a time to talk thanks a lot headphones)"
8108,4.0,"I like that they don't have a chord, but they could be improved by making them easier to stay in my ears"
8109,4.0, I'm used to in ear monitors that fit snugly down in my ear canal
8110,4.0," It has taken me a couple of weeks to figure out the best way to put them in my ears, so they don't fall out"
8111,4.0, The noise cancellation is nonexistent
8112,4.0, I have some bluetooth headphones that work much better than these
8113,4.0, When I'm wearing these airpods I know if someone is talking to me
8114,4.0," If I want to drown out the noise, I'll have to wear my headphones instead"
8115,5.0,I lost my last set of Airpods after three years
8116,5.0,"the battery life was getting bad, so I was happy to buy another pari while waiting for the new Airpod Pro's to be back in stock"
8117,5.0,I really love these headphones
8118,5.0, They stay in my ears (even while running a 1/2 marathon) and have great sound quality
8119,5.0,They charge fast and last for several hours while listening to books podcasts etc
8120,5.0,They are worth the $$
8121,5.0,Just don't lose them or it will break your heart
8122,5.0, Luckily I got them quick with PRIME
8123,2.0,I've had issues with the right Airpod since I purchased these
8124,2.0, It always dies way before the left Airpod
8125,2.0, I have tried cleaning it and the case
8126,2.0, I have tried repairing the device and all of the other Apple suggestions on what to do when this happens
8127,2.0, Nothing has fixed the problem
8128,2.0, I try charging just the right Airpod at times and my iPhone will say it i fully charged but then I will only get about 5 minutes of listen time before it dies again
8129,2.0," Not sure if I got a faulty pair, but it is really frustrating since I spent so much on these"
8130,5.0,These air pods are much more comfortable than I imagined they would be and the sound quality is fantastic
8131,5.0, I’m very pleased with this purchase
8132,5.0," I let my hubby check them out and he looked at me and said, “Get me a pair”"
8133,5.0, Looking forward to sharpening my beginning French skills and listening to awesome music
8134,5.0, Great bargain
8135,5.0,Finally got the AirPods after months of denying the need for it
8136,5.0," If you are a MacBook user and upgrade to any of the iphones post iPhone 6s, you’ll end end up with headphones that work with your phone but not the MacBook Pro"
8137,5.0," So annoying, Apple"
8138,5.0, So eventually you’ll have to get the AirPods to solve the problem (so that you don’t carry the dongle everywhere only to lose it)
8139,5.0,Now the actual product review - good design allowing the headphones to charge while in the case
8140,5.0, These work best for just about everything except workout (coz sweat may spoil them) and flight travel (no noise canceling)
8141,5.0, I've wanted wireless headphones since before airpods became a thing
8142,5.0," These are exactly as promised, and came sealed in a white apple box"
8143,5.0, They hold a charge for like 8 hrs of continuous use and I've had them about a month
8144,5.0, I love to take them on walks with me so I can listen to podcasts
8145,5.0, I've used them on phonecalls and haven't had an issue
8146,1.0,Me acaban de llegar mis AirPods y vienen totalmente sucios
8147,1.0,Con varios rayones
8148,1.0,Descargados
8149,1.0,Boy a poner a cargar para revisar si funciona bien
8150,1.0,Desepcionado
8151,2.0,There is a serious deteriorating bluetooth connection issue with iPhone (11 pro)
8152,2.0, It becomes more and more common after half year of use that iPhone shows the airpods are connected but the sound still goes to speaker; or there is no sounds in either airpods or speakers
8153,2.0, It's unclear what's the issue
8154,2.0, I typically have to try turn the bluetooth on and off several times before it's back to normal state
8155,4.0,"I am loving my new Airpods, and I do not even have an iPhone"
8156,4.0, These are just great headphones and they are so much less expensive than the newest latest and greatest model
8157,4.0,One thing I would recommend is to buy those little ear hook things that help the ear bud stay in your ear
8158,4.0, These are especially helpful when using the Airpods for working out/running
8159,4.0,"Otherwise, the case fits conveniently in your pocket, its lightweight, battery life is great, these are perfect"
8160,3.0,Have sent in 3 times for repair
8161,3.0, First time only had for 4 1/2 months
8162,3.0, Left AirPod sound muted
8163,3.0, Nothing I have done
8164,3.0, Returned to Apple they “fixed” it but now 2 months later same problem
8165,3.0, Sending back AGAIN
8166,3.0, Ridiculous after spending over $100 on them
8167,3.0, Not worth it in my opinion
8168,5.0,"I am an apple fan, and the airpods is a no brainer when it comes to wireless earphones if you adopted the apple ecosystem"
8169,5.0, I really like the feature where it auto connects to your apple device when taken out and also it remembers which apple device you last listen to and connects to that
8170,5.0, Also the auto pausing feature it has just puts it way ahead of other competitors
8171,5.0, And not to forget the image upgrade it brings to the person wearing it
8172,5.0, Definitely a buy
8173,4.0,"(READ ALL)I bought these AirPods off of Amazon, for my daughter’s birthday, She was so happy and excited"
8174,4.0, I was a little worried of them being fake or not working properly or anything like that
8175,4.0, But I was completely wrong they work amazing the sound quality is great
8176,4.0, To be able to get both of your AirPods charged equally make sure that your charging case is fully charged
8177,4.0, And then overnight place in your AirPods insider charging case that way you have your AirPods and AirPod Case charge for the rest of the day
8178,4.0, I have not had any technical difficulties so far with the AirPods
8179,4.0," They are very comfortable, they don’t slip out MY ears"
8180,4.0,In my opinion these are great
8181,4.0," If you go out a lot and love listening to music and don’t want to have wired headphones and having the wire dangling around, this would be a great option for you if you love going on runs, or just in general go out a lot And wanna listen to music these are great"
8182,4.0, Love them and would recommend you to buy them
8183,4.0, (They also work amazing with phone calls)
8184,4.0,( also the button on the back is to turn it off and on) The sound quality on this is amazing it doesn’t have the best noise cancellation but if someone’s talking to you you probably wouldn’t hear them but sound is amazing and it’s loud enough
8185,3.0,These seem a bit larger in the ear than the earphones that come with the phone
8186,3.0, They are tight fitting with no way of adjusting the fit
8187,3.0, Right ear started hurting as the airpod felt like it was pressing against the cartilage of the ear
8188,3.0," Strangely they feel so tight that my ears begin to hurt after 30 min of use, but also they feel like they will fall put of the ear because they are super smooth"
8189,3.0, I should have waited for the air-pod pros
8190,3.0," I was going to give these to the girlfriend, but she doesnt even want them"
8191,3.0," Do not fall asleep with them, woke up from ear pain"
8192,5.0,"I’m so glad I got these after holding off on them for so long😎 I had some Bose SSW earbuds before these and honestly, these are significantly better IMO"
8193,5.0, I’m gonna keep this short so here are the 3 main things I love;
8194,5.0,1
8195,5.0, Instant pairing
8196,5.0,2
8197,5.0," Sound quality (phone calls, music, movies)"
8198,5.0,3
8199,5.0, Find my AirPods (only works if it’s connected BUT you can still get the last known location)
8200,4.0,"I like them a lot and get pumped by the music, but I have always had a tough time keeping any ear bud or earphone"
8201,4.0,"in my ear, I always needed the soft silicone pieces to stick"
8202,4.0, I don't know if there is a way to get a soft cover over these
8203,4.0,to help me keep the air pods IN
8204,4.0,UPDATE: Just bought a pair of ear hooks that loop over the ear and NOW I can listen to air pods and enjoy
8205,4.0,the sound while I workout or do lawn work
8206,4.0, I wish the ear hooks were around 2 years ago when I first bought them
8207,4.0,There's not much bad to say
8208,4.0," They work great, the pod charger thing is a a great idea"
8209,4.0,"Problem is, with careful use, my last pair lasted about 14 months before they just died"
8210,4.0, That's way to short a life span
8211,4.0,"Still, when it comes to usage, it's better than anything like it"
8212,4.0, Sigh
8213,4.0, I hate you Apple
8214,4.0," Now take my money, damn you"
8215,5.0,Ive never been able to find a good pair of rubber tipped headphones that fit or stay in your ear while active so the wired Apple headphones have always worked best for me
8216,5.0, I got a new phone with no aux port so had to switch to wireless
8217,5.0, These fit the exact same as the normal wired headphones that used to come with new iPhones
8218,5.0, Good purchase
8219,5.0,Love how they fit
8220,5.0, Like that I can listen to one while the other charges
8221,5.0, Never without battery life
8222,5.0, Love the case
8223,5.0, Nice and sturdy
8224,5.0,Great for while you’re working you can answer phone calls or send and receive texts with a tap on your ear
8225,5.0, No more digging for my phone just to see it’s a spam call
8226,5.0,Extra bonus…got them on sale
8227,5.0,These are the real deal Apple AirPods 2
8228,5.0, The headphones themselves are the newer version 2 but the case is just the older style and not wireless charging
8229,5.0, I really didn’t need the wireless charging so I just went with these
8230,5.0, Works great and the battery life is stellar
8231,5.0, I use em all day and only have to charge every couples days
8232,5.0, Would definitely buy again
8233,5.0,I almost bought the third generation but had concerns about them fitting or staying in my ears
8234,5.0, These are a great product and the price was far less than on the Apple web site
8235,5.0, They link quickly to my devices and have good sound quality
8236,5.0, They also came on the day I ordered them
8237,5.0, Very pleased with this purchase
8238,5.0,"They fit well, are convenient, and the battery life is surprisingly long"
8239,5.0," I get 2-3 charges from the case which lasts me 2 days, but I literally have my airpods in 24/7"
8240,5.0, I am an avid runner and these stay locked in my ears the entire time
8241,5.0,"I've had a tiny bit of issue where sometimes (rarely) one airpod won't play anything, but putting them back in the case and taking them out again fixes it"
8242,5.0,"The only downside is that since I have long hair and these are wireless, people will try to talk to me and I won't hear them, giving the impression that I am ignoring people and being rude"
8243,3.0,"Really makes me angry that Apple has proprietary stuff, and then it doesn’t work"
8244,3.0, These lasted about 20 months before beginning to have connective issues intermittently
8245,3.0, Now the right one won’t work at all
8246,3.0, So now I’m stuck blowing away another $200 bucks to replace them
8247,3.0, That’s b
8248,3.0,s
8249,3.0, And not the only one complaining about this
8250,5.0,In my original review I noted that the airpods are very comfortable and convenient to pair with Iphone and computer
8251,5.0," They seem to be optimized for music, where they sound pretty good"
8252,5.0," However, they were problematic for listening to voices on telephone or zoom"
8253,5.0, Voices were muddy
8254,5.0, But today I discovered that you can do a custom adjustment on the iphone (settings>accessibility>Audio/Visual>Headphone Accommodations - yes it's buried deep)
8255,5.0, With that I now get voice sound on telephone and on zoom (using the iphone for zoom) that is great
8256,5.0, The only problem is that I can't find any way to get that adjustment when I am using the Airpods with my macbook pro
8257,5.0, Zoom on the mac is very muddy voice
8258,5.0," Apple, please address that"
8259,5.0,Works perfectly
8260,5.0, Love them
8261,5.0," As far as Apple AirPods in general, I wish the tapping controls had more functionality but in general I love the look and feel and quality experience of them"
8262,5.0, Yeah
8263,5.0, If I lost these I’d buy another set
8264,5.0," But, I also keep my wired buds and also a cheap Anker wireless buds that give more control over the functions"
8265,5.0, They all sound good and all have their uses
8266,4.0,I got these for a substantial discount
8267,4.0, So I wasn't expecting them to be wonderful
8268,4.0, The sound quality was excellent
8269,4.0, The noise cancellation was very good
8270,4.0, The battery life was average
8271,4.0, And I have a hard time keeping them in my ears
8272,4.0," But they work and for the kinds of calls that I do, they are sufficient"
8273,4.0," But if you want something for exercising or longer listing periods, probably not your best choice"
8274,1.0,I've tried for two weeks to get used to these airpods
8275,1.0, Bought some silicon covers to help hold them in my ear
8276,1.0," As the silicon warms up, they fall out anyway"
8277,1.0, Just slip out without any encouragement
8278,1.0," And even though they don't fit snug enough to stay in my ears, they are miserably uncomfortable"
8279,1.0, I wore them for a walk today and five hours later my ears still ache
8280,1.0,I liked everything else about these
8281,1.0, :(
8282,1.0,You can’t hear out of them
8283,1.0, You need to turn the volume all the way up and then the sound is so muffled and you can’t hear it clearly
8284,1.0, Everyone around you can hear a muffled noise also when it’s at the top volume
8285,1.0, My kids would rather use the cheap headphones that come with the phone rather than these
8286,1.0, We tried fixing with tips on Fb and Apple
8287,1.0, Nothing worked
8288,1.0, I bought 2 of these for my kids and they won’t even use them
8289,1.0, So disappointed
8290,4.0,"I didn't even consider buying AirPods for a while, as there are definitely many more affordable options for bluetooth earphones"
8291,4.0," However, I never seemed to be fully satisfied with the other options I tried"
8292,4.0," The sound quality is great, they connect flawlessly and I love that it's easy to switch between devices"
8293,4.0,"My only concern is that I have smaller ears and thick, puffy hair"
8294,4.0, I sometimes find the AirPods will get loose due to the fit or getting caught in my hair
8295,4.0," Not a deal breaker for me, but I can't see myself wearing them when I'm too active because I'm fearful I may lose one"
8296,2.0,"After the second time I tried them, the left airpod would no longer charge and had to bring them to the apple store"
8297,2.0, The apple store representative told me the AirPods were defective and that I needed to contact Amazon to get them replaced
8298,2.0, Talked to Amazon and they are replacing them
8299,2.0, Apple needs to fix this charging issue with the AirPods stems because they don’t last very long or are defective or cheaply made
8300,5.0,I have been an Apple fanboy since they came out with iPods
8301,5.0," These little guys are amazingly light weight, sound quality is amazing, and I can have in on for most of the day without worrying about the battery life"
8302,5.0," I did not get the noise canceling ones, but with these on I can hardly hear other noises around me"
8303,5.0, Must have item in my opinion
8304,5.0,My first pair lasted just about a month and the left one failed
8305,5.0,no more sound in L AirPod
8306,5.0,I called AMAZON and I had a new replacement within 2 days
8307,5.0, This second pair works great so far
8308,5.0,My son has had these for several years and has never had a problem with sound or charging
8309,5.0, He steered me towards this product and I am glad
8310,5.0,So much easier to be using the AirPods for phone calls and not having to hold my phone anymore or use the speaker
8311,5.0, I hear well with these and I can walk away from my phone to attend to something I need to do
8312,5.0, Others hear me well when I am conversing with them on the phone while using the AirPods
8313,5.0,"Very good product, excellent Amazon support for first 30 days or so on this item and then continued support is available through Amazon"
8314,3.0,I've had my AirPods for about 2 months and I've had some discomfort with the left one
8315,3.0, I figured I'd get used to it and discovered today that I have a small cut inside my ear from an uneven seam on the AirPod
8316,3.0,"On the plus side, the sound quality is great and I like the functions available through the AirPods"
8317,3.0," If you're new to AirPods, take the time to go through the Tips section on your iPhone"
8318,4.0,I prefer how this earbuds fit in my ear but YMMV
8319,4.0, Sound is decent enough for music and podcasts
8320,4.0, Battery life could be a bit better but the case and earbuds charge fast
8321,4.0, Occasionally I have pairing issues with my iPhone 11 but it’s a quick fix when it happens
8322,4.0, Next to no sound isolation so if that’s a priority for you look elsewhere
8323,1.0,I've bought two pairs of airpods
8324,1.0, The first was last year for my boyfriend
8325,1.0, They work great and he's never had any problems
8326,1.0, I bought a pair for myself and it would never connect to my phone or charge and I was easily able to return/exchange
8327,1.0," Now I'm on my third pair and they were fine for about 2 weeks, now the left one doesn't charge at all"
8328,1.0," Trust me I've tried everything humanly possible to fix it and I cannot, even when the case and airpods were full charged they died within 2 hours of use"
8329,1.0," Of course, the return window ended like 3 days ago"
8330,1.0," I really want my money back so I can just buy directly from Apple, these same fake"
8331,1.0, Don't waste your money
8332,5.0,I’ve wanted a pair of air pods since they first came out but never could bring myself to pay that much for headphones
8333,5.0, Well I’m glad I finally did because these little guys are amazing
8334,5.0," The battery life lasts almost all day for me, the sound is incredible"
8335,5.0, They don’t cancel out a lot of noise which is what I wanted anyways since I have kids and need to be able to hear them when they call for me
8336,5.0, I think these AirPods are worth every penny because I use them everyday and I’m in love with them
8337,5.0, Not a single complaint from me
8338,1.0,This is the second pair of air pods ordered
8339,1.0, The right side won’t work
8340,1.0, These were for my teenage daughter
8341,1.0," She spent 2 hours on the phone with 7 different Apple techs to troubleshoot, only to find out that that the serial number on the box doesn’t match the air pods so they couldn’t help her"
8342,1.0, They said it the fault of Amazon for mixing up the box with the pods
8343,1.0, We will be returning these
8344,1.0, Not sure how that can happen
8345,5.0,I love my AirPods
8346,5.0, I read all the negative reviews saying there fake but I don’t agree
8347,5.0, the sound quality is good and they sync and work perfectly with my iPhone
8348,5.0, These are not the current generation AirPods but Its not a big deal to me
8349,5.0, the charging light is in the inside and not the outside because its not a current model and I compared my AirPods with AirPods sold in a large retail store and they look the same and the price was exactly the same
8350,5.0," If you want current generation AirPods they will cost you more money but they function exactly the same way, not a big difference"
8351,2.0,I can’t really give a full review on this
8352,2.0, I will say that when I first opened them both pods( left and right) worked
8353,2.0," However, after trying them on a second time"
8354,2.0, It seemed that only 1 side would work
8355,2.0, I thought maybe just needed a reset
8356,2.0, After resetting it every way you could possibly imagine
8357,2.0, There was simply no way to have both AirPods work at the same time
8358,2.0, Once I put both AirPods in the case
8359,2.0, The flashing amber lights come on
8360,2.0, I did try to hold the button for 15 seconds
8361,2.0, Still didn't work
8362,2.0, Getting a replacement one sent
8363,2.0, Hopefully this doesn’t have any problems
8364,2.0,I bought these expecting a nicely polished product from Apple
8365,2.0, I got the opposite
8366,2.0," They cut out horribly nonstop, and I have tried troubleshooting them from every angle possible"
8367,2.0," I am working from home, and spend most of the day on the phone"
8368,2.0," These have caused more problems that they are worth, and they're likely going to end up in the trash"
8369,2.0, I would not recommend buying these for remote work purposes
8370,2.0," They also amplify strange noises, like quietly opening packages/envelopes"
8371,2.0," Sounds like that are amplified through the mic, and are deafening to people on the other side"
8372,2.0,"All that being said, for simple music listening, they work"
8373,2.0," The audio quality is so-so, but they work"
8374,2.0, It's nice to not have to hassle with cords at the gym
8375,5.0,"I tried the Samsung Galaxy Buds before these (they had good reviews and were cheaper), but they didn’t fit my ears well, they pressed on the cartilage in my ears and the sound was not at good"
8376,5.0, So I got these and I ave been SUPER happy
8377,5.0," They fit just like the ear buds that come with iPhones (so not perfect, but they are comfortable for smaller ears)"
8378,5.0," I use one at a time while listening to podcasts, books, or talking on them to make the battery last longer"
8379,5.0,I purchased these hoping would hate them and could subsequently return them
8380,5.0," Unfortunately, I immediately loved them"
8381,5.0," While I initially thought they were pricey, I would say the cost is justified for the product"
8382,5.0," They seem to be a bit more comfortable than the regular apple earbuds, and fit well in my ear even with a daith piercing (regular earbuds did not fit)"
8383,5.0, Sound and battery quality is great
8384,5.0, I love that they fit in tiny skinny jean pockets so that I can always have them with me
8385,5.0," As a bonus, I feel like a cool person when walking around with these, as I bought them maybe a year after they became popular"
8386,5.0,My first wireless earbuds
8387,5.0, I’ve had Apple’s wired buds forever and decided to try the wireless
8388,5.0, Ordered the AirPods 3 but they were too big for my ear canal and I worried about them falling out
8389,5.0, Sent them back and got the AirPods 2 and they fit just like the old wired ones
8390,5.0," The 2’s may not have quite as good a sound as the 3’s but, honestly, I’m not sitting in a dark room listening to every note of “Dark Side of the Moon”- I have over-the ears for that"
8391,1.0,I’m not sure how legit these are
8392,1.0, My boyfriend purchased his headphones from Walmart and we did a comparison as far as how long these things hold charge
8393,1.0, Today I disconnected my headphones early in the morning
8394,1.0, We were both at 100% at 12pm now 8pm and he’s at 80% and I’m at 30% I spent a lot of money on these like everyone else
8395,1.0, Last thing I want to do is to keep exchanging something I had less than a week 🤨
8396,2.0,"This product was great, but after about 5 months they stopped syncing to my phone"
8397,2.0, I ran every diagnostic test and tried everything the internet and Apple told me to try
8398,2.0, Still nothing
8399,2.0,It's obnoxious that products like these are beholden to the one month return window
8400,2.0, That's okay for something like a shirt or mop
8401,2.0, But tech should have a much longer window
8402,2.0,Just another reason I stopped buying from Amazon
8403,4.0,"These are great and comfortable to wear although they have fell out of my ear several times, which is worrisome"
8404,4.0, They charge really fast which is a plus and can last a while
8405,4.0, I wish they were a little bit louder although that probably wouldn’t be best if you’re worried about your hearing
8406,4.0, I like the fact that they are cordless but I wish I could use them while on my laptop
8407,4.0, I haven’t been able too
8408,5.0,"First off These are gen 2 airpods in a gen 1 case so it comes with the added Siri functionality and such, just not the wireless charging of course"
8409,5.0," They sound pretty crisp for the most part, and they embrace bass instead of being allergic to it like some cheaper wireless earbuds"
8410,5.0," They charge really really fast too, 15 minutes of charging for 3 hours of playtime"
8411,5.0," The experience is seamless, everything works as it should consistently"
8412,5.0, Not many earbuds topping these besides the pros of course
8413,5.0, Good buy
8414,5.0,"All right, I've seen waaaaayy too many reviews about how these airpods are the first generation instead of the second"
8415,5.0, LOOK AT THE PICTURE
8416,5.0, It literally that the dot is in the case instead of outside
8417,5.0," C'mon, guys, we're in like the future now"
8418,5.0, Also I just showed a picture to show how cool lookin they lookin look
8419,5.0, (Btw please clean your airpods guys it's so disgusting when I see earwax all around in the case and in the airpods)
8420,3.0,Arrived with the left one not working
8421,3.0," So, I ran to my local Apple store"
8422,3.0, They had to send it out for repair
8423,3.0, That was on Saturday and they were delivered back to my home by Tuesday
8424,3.0," So, it was a little frustrating to have them arrive not working, but having them fixed was pretty pain-free and I only had to wait a couple extra days"
8425,3.0, I do love my airpods
8426,5.0,Sounds perfect
8427,5.0, They are original Apple AirPods in the original box wrapped up in plastic
8428,5.0, Been already using it for about 2 hours and battery life is at same percentage
8429,5.0, Came with a charger
8430,5.0, Easy to pair once I took my iPhone out it automatically asked to pair
8431,5.0,Was torn between this one and the Pro model but I’m glad I went with the regular AirPods 2
8432,5.0, They are super comfy and sound quality is plenty good for my liking
8433,5.0, Battery life is superb and I use it everyday
8434,5.0, I don’t have any complaints
8435,5.0, Only con I can think of is that the case can attract all kinds of lint and other things when they are in your pants pockets all day
8436,5.0, No biggie tho
8437,5.0, Love mine
8438,4.0,Please disregard my first review as there was a bit of confusion as to APPLE's warranty v
8439,4.0,s
8440,4.0, seller's RETURN policy
8441,4.0," The seller, as it turns out, was never at fault in this case for which I do humbly apologize"
8442,4.0, The seller deserves an A+++
8443,4.0, but the product itself does not due to the intermittent performance & extremely short reception distance
8444,4.0, I will be relying on the manufacturer's 1 year warranty 
8445,1.0,These consistently play at max volume for the first 10 seconds they start up
8446,1.0, I am usually good about remembering and let them play super load before they quiet back down to a reasonable volume
8447,1.0, Yesterday I forgot and now I think I have permanent hearing damage
8448,1.0, for over 24 hours I have had a constant high pitch sound in my ear
8449,1.0, I will be going to my doctor tomorrow to talk about the potential damage these headphones did to my hearing
8450,1.0, 1 star because it is legitimately dangerous to use
8451,5.0,"I know some people were concerned that this was a knockoff product, but it was not"
8452,5.0, I received the Airpods in original Apple packaging with serial number
8453,5.0, I am very happy with my purchase as it was exactly what I expected
8454,5.0," Good wireless headphones for everyday use that transfers with easy between my many Apple products (MacBook, iPad, and iPhone)"
8455,5.0," That's easily the best part for me, their smooth integration with all other Apple products"
8456,5.0," They are not the top of the line wireless headphones for sound quality and features, if that is what you're looking for, but perfect for my daily use"
8457,5.0,I didn’t want AirPods
8458,5.0,I didn’t think they looked good
8459,5.0,I didn’t think they would look good on me
8460,5.0,"Then, my brother got them for me"
8461,5.0, And i’ve never been more grateful
8462,5.0," They’re Incredible, they’re so convenient and sturdy"
8463,5.0, I’ve dropped them from 4-6 feet plenty of times and they barely even scratch
8464,5.0," I promise you’ll like them once you have them, and if you already want them you’ll be grateful if you do get them"
8465,5.0, I even got my girlfriend (who didn’t want airpods) some and she too loves them now
8466,5.0, It’s easily worth the money
8467,5.0,I was a little hesitant to get these at first
8468,5.0, I had heard reports of AirPods falling out of people’s ears and getting lost
8469,5.0, I had one of my AirPods fall off on a plane seat
8470,5.0," Other than that, I have not had any other problems with my AirPods"
8471,5.0," Siri does require you to speak clearly when making requests, so don’t mumble"
8472,5.0, Or else she’ll not understand what you want her to do for you
8473,5.0,I bought these expecting to have an issue with them falling out like standard wired earbuds
8474,5.0," I was wrong, I have had them over 2 months now and have not had them drop out yet"
8475,5.0," This past weekend, I was doing a major system upgrade for work which had me on my Cell phone in a noisy Ice rink (kid had hockey camp), and I was on a Webex for 8 hours 2 days in a row, the great thing was after 3 hours, of talk time I knew I would need to charge them"
8476,5.0, but was able to do them one at a time and then go back to both of them
8477,5.0, The sound quality and background noise elimination were great
8478,5.0,The batteries on my original AirPods failed after about a year so I needed a replacement
8479,5.0," I thought about upgrading to “Pro,” but the price scared me off"
8480,5.0, These are excellent
8481,5.0, Their device switching is must better than my original pair and the battery life is much improved also
8482,5.0, Comfortable to wear with excellent audio quality and the microphone pick up for calls is unsurpassed in a device this small
8483,1.0,Right earplug is discharging to 0% in a charging case if both earplugs are being charging
8484,1.0,If I eject left earplug from the case then right earplug starts charging
8485,1.0,Support person just walked me through standard script without reading (or understanding) what is my problem
8486,1.0, If it is 0% charged - let me explain how to charge it
8487,1.0, If it is 100% charged then let me explain how to reset connection
8488,1.0, F#
8489,1.0, My problem is I cannot charge both plugs simultaneously but there is no script about this and they do not want to listen to me
8490,5.0,"I bought these from one of the used offers so they were a little bit cheaper, no damages to the box or anything, they were basically brand new, just had to change the name once I paired them to my phone"
8491,5.0, They were exactly what I was expecting and I'd definitely purchase again
8492,5.0, Thanks Apple
8493,5.0,Made the purchase for my son
8494,5.0," He uses how iPods for social media, music and his virtual learning"
8495,5.0," Like any child’s he can sometimes misplace them, cost makes them easier to replace when lost"
8496,5.0, The fact that I can replace them if lost or damaged if I add them to my apple coverage with my other devices reduces my cost when they do have to be replaced
8497,5.0, More often then not lower cost items cannot be insured
8498,4.0,I loved them at first
8499,4.0, Great integrated design with the charging case
8500,4.0, Super fast linking to iPhone
8501,4.0, They have always been in the house and have never seen any moisture or other contaminants
8502,4.0, The sound quality is quite bad; high end is cut quite a bit
8503,4.0, Often have to reposition the left one in order to balance out the volume
8504,4.0, I was a big fan but can’t stand them now
8505,5.0,Love my air pods
8506,5.0, Use them for work everyday
8507,5.0, Wires always got in the way while doing construction
8508,5.0, With wireless ear buds makes everything so much easier
8509,5.0, Love them they look great for a nice case for them to keep them protected
8510,5.0, They last pretty long
8511,5.0, I use one ear bud at a time so they last me all day
8512,1.0,"After a month of regular use, these AirPods will begin to show faulty behavior"
8513,1.0," More often now when taking the AirPods out of the case and putting them into my ears, one AirPod does not work"
8514,1.0," So, then I have to constantly place them both back into the case, close the cover, and start over again; or disconnect the AirPods and re-connect them through bluetooth"
8515,1.0, This is extremely frustrating and inconvenient when you need them to work
8516,1.0," Apple needs to ensure that their products can perform even basic functions as intended before releasing them to the consumer market - totally useless, defective tech"
8517,2.0,I'm not sure if these are genuine Apple or not
8518,2.0, I've owned another pair before which work as you'd expect but i bought them from the Apple store when they first came out
8519,2.0, The ones from Amazon don't seem to connect right away and sometimes i have to manually tell it to connect to my bluetooth on my iPhone SE again
8520,2.0, I tried these on my wife's 11 Pro and same thing occurred; it took a long time to connect
8521,4.0,Beautiful quality in appearance and function
8522,4.0,My ears are too small for these and they became painful after a little while
8523,4.0,Then when I didn’t put them in as far to avoid pain I didn’t take them out when I got up and they fell out
8524,4.0,It would be a welcome addition to include little adapters
8525,5.0,Am avid runner and iOS user
8526,5.0, Switched to wireless earbuds a year ago and never looked back
8527,5.0, These work for me and stay in my ears for 10+ mile runs while sweating
8528,5.0," Battery life is great, works with Siri, and range of Bluetooth great"
8529,5.0, Haven’t used during cold weather yet
8530,5.0, A lot better than those $40 knock offs I bought first
8531,5.0,One time a did experience where only one AirPod was working
8532,5.0," I just turned Bluetooth off and back on, it was remedied"
8533,5.0, It might be because I don’t keep my Bluetooth on all the time due to me browsing NSFW content frequently
8534,5.0, Haven’t had the problem since
8535,4.0,I actually like these earbuds and feel that they fit comfortably in my ears
8536,4.0, I have super small ear canals and the earbuds that fit IN my ears never fit comfortably
8537,4.0, I downloaded an app that enables me to get my calls and to hang up by tapping the earbuds (as if I had an iPhone)
8538,4.0, I've been pleased with the sound quality and those who are on the other end of my calls have noted that the call quality is really good
8539,4.0, Battery life could be better but overall all this is a good purchase for sure
8540,5.0,These things are great
8541,5.0, The hey Siri feature makes them much better than the original version
8542,5.0, I wasn’t a fan of the AirPods Pro with the supposed noise cancelation as they just created white noise and I felt every bump in the road in my ear drums
8543,5.0," So, you get a great product that just works with the base model"
8544,5.0," Also, I didn’t see the need for wireless charging as the case lasts a long time and only needs charged two or three times a week"
8545,5.0, (unless you use them for 16hours a day
8546,5.0,)
8547,4.0,"If you're looking for noise cancelling/ sound quality, these are not the right headphones"
8548,4.0, I have better quality headphones for the gym
8549,4.0," I wanted these for work and school, to be discrete about my listening"
8550,4.0, I didn't want it to be noise canceling because I still wanted to be able to hear people talking to me
8551,5.0,"Every kind of headphone hurts my ears; over-ear or in-ear, cheap and expensive"
8552,5.0," I can’t have them on/in for more that an hour, and even that’s stretching it"
8553,5.0," I decided to try these because there was an Amazon coupon, and they are definitely the best I’ve tried"
8554,5.0, I can barely feel them in
8555,5.0," And they are pain-free to set up, as in no setup/pairing needed AT ALL"
8556,5.0, I love how I can go from listening on my iPad to my iPhone to my Macbook with no complications whatsoever
8557,5.0, Great buy
8558,5.0,Bought this pair as a gift for my mom but own my own
8559,5.0, I use them daily for working out they fit my ear well are never uncomfortable and never fall out even during lots of jumping sound Quality is great And the battery life is amazing I can typically use them For the gym a few days In a row before they die however I typically just plug the case in to charge during my workout so they just stay charged all the time
8560,1.0,The air pods refuse to connect to my iPhone and when it does it’s for a split second
8561,1.0, The second it connects to my phone it immediately disconnects before any sound comes out of it
8562,1.0," I messaged the “seller” or whatever to ask what I could do to make them work and they never answered, and since my mom has been in the hospital money is tight and now I can’t even return them"
8563,1.0," Worst experience buying from here, and I am furious about it"
8564,2.0,"So yea my AirPods won't connect to any of my devices and yes before u ask i did reset, repair and try the stuff they tell you to do online"
8565,2.0, Im heading into the apple store this weekend to see id they can help but the fact that i haven't had these for even a year and there acting up is straight up annoying especially because of the price point
8566,2.0, now don't get me wrong i really enjoyed these up until now but idk what's going on I've never got them wet and have only dropped them about twice when they fell out of my ear when i bent down to grab something
8567,2.0, Ill update if i can get them fixed at the apple store but as of right now its a no from me I'm a bit disappointed
8568,1.0,After owning these for less than one year the right AirPod started to sound lower than the left AirPod
8569,1.0, A week later the left AirPod began to sound low as well
8570,1.0," Now, I can hardly hear any sound out of both AirPods"
8571,1.0, I have to turn the volume up to the max just to hear out of my AirPods
8572,1.0, I’m disappointed because these AirPods won’t last longer than a year
8573,5.0,I'm an office manager so I spend a great deal of time on the phone and typing on my keyboard at the same time
8574,5.0, The airpods work great for me
8575,5.0," I was so tired of trying to hold my phone to my ear by leaning to one shoulder or the other, or putting my phone on speaker, which bothered my boss"
8576,5.0, Now I can talk hands free without crimping my neck or making the whole office listen to the speaker phone
8577,5.0," Also, it works great because no one I speak to when using the airpods has to ask me to repeat myself"
8578,5.0, They can hear me loud and clear now
8579,5.0, :-)
8580,5.0,These were a Christmas gift for our daughter who was tired of having her iPhone fall and jerk her earbuds out of her ears
8581,5.0, She says these are great and she loves them
8582,5.0, She said she walked quite a distance from her phone without thinking and was surprised that they still worked from that far away
8583,5.0," So, I guess I would recommend them since she’s happy"
8584,5.0,I chose the gen 2 over the recent releases because the shape of it fits perfect in my ear
8585,5.0," The ones with the round rubber ear piece at the end usually fall out or come loose, but these sit perfect in my ear"
8586,5.0," The sound quality is great, super easy to pair with my phone, and those it's not noise cancelling, turning up what you're listening to usually covers it"
8587,5.0, Highly recommend
8588,5.0,"I been wanting a pair of AirPods for a while now, but never really had the funds for them due to how expensive they were"
8589,5.0, But I saw these and I knew I had to have them once they came down in price
8590,5.0, They arrived today and they really live up to the name
8591,5.0, I been using them all day and I love how they fit in my ears comfortably and how easy it was to pair them
8592,5.0," Not only that,but the sound quality is amazing and I love the little case it comes in"
8593,5.0, It's so cute
8594,5.0," If you love Apple products, then this is for you"
8595,5.0, Five stars
8596,1.0,Back to school time
8597,1.0,time to purchase my 5th pair of airpods for my teenager
8598,1.0, Did you know teenagers can lose one or both earbuds with such regularity
8599,1.0," Apple is so smart to sell these to teenagers, knowing they will be repeat customers by default for life"
8600,1.0," No, I will not buy the Pro's"
8601,1.0," I'm a sucker, but not that stupid"
8602,5.0,These are the real deal
8603,5.0, I love them
8604,5.0, Didn’t realize I needed them till I started wearing them
8605,5.0,I can walk around the house without my phone attached to my hand and carry on a conversation while doing other things
8606,5.0,Sound quality on both sides is excellent
8607,5.0,"Also, they stay put"
8608,5.0,even while jogging
8609,5.0, Comfortable and charge quickly
8610,5.0,Not as bulky as my beloved Bose
8611,5.0, Great to have both
8612,5.0,I wear these every day
8613,5.0, Excellent ear buds
8614,4.0,I believe ear pods stretch out your earholes the way your feet stretch out leather slip on shoes
8615,4.0, After using a few days EarPods fell out
8616,4.0, I had phantom pod syndrome and it still felt jammed in even though it was missing
8617,4.0, I think i will have to return to wireless that are wired together as they don't sell replacements
8618,4.0, So I am looking for a left side if anyone is stuck with a half set
8619,5.0,"I was NOT looking for a noise cancelling plugs, just a handsfree ""headset"""
8620,5.0, I'm on the phone a lot and the wired earpods were starting to get on my nerves
8621,5.0, Got these at a $100 sale
8622,5.0, exactly what I was looking for
8623,5.0,"I need external ambience feedback when I'm on the phone -- otherwise I tend to speak very loud --, and these are perfect for that purpose"
8624,5.0,"at $100, very happy with the gen2"
8625,5.0,Great all around headphones
8626,5.0, I use them to work out and they stay in throughout
8627,5.0, Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time
8628,5.0, The sound quality is good as long as your expectations are not that high because these are not noise canceling or over the ear headphones
8629,5.0," If you just need some good wireless headphones with great battery life, comfortable on most ears and sound good get this"
8630,5.0,I really can’t say enough good things about these AirPods
8631,5.0, I have purchased the “knock off” brands that look similar and have had multiple problems with them
8632,5.0, I was a little hesitant in spending the extra cash
8633,5.0, compared to the $30 “knock offs”
8634,5.0," But after opening the box the AirPods, they immediately were recognized by mu iPhone"
8635,5.0, The sound quality was probably the best I have ever experienced with earbuds
8636,5.0, I think they are better than a pair of Bose that I used to use
8637,5.0, These are the real deal
8638,5.0, The size of the case is smaller and feels very well constructed
8639,5.0, Like I said
8640,5.0, I am completely satisfied and would recommend
8641,5.0, do not waste your time on the “knock off” brands
8642,5.0, Go for the AirPods
8643,5.0,Thanks
8644,5.0,Jay
8645,5.0,Apple did not disappoint with these AirPods
8646,5.0," I hesitated because it’s a big price commitment, but I’ve been sooo happy with them"
8647,5.0," The sound is so clear, the charge time is great"
8648,5.0," If you receive a call or text, Alexa will tell you and you just speak a return text or tell her yes or no if you want to accept the call, then music will resume afterward"
8649,5.0, Ultimate
8650,5.0, Boom
8651,5.0, Mic drop
8652,2.0,"Very cheap product, it always disconnects and has a hard time connecting"
8653,2.0, It’s a noticeable difference that this one is lighter to apple AirPods from the apple store
8654,2.0, Honestly for 100$ this was a ripoff
8655,2.0, So many headphones with way better sound and cheaper that I could’ve gotten instead of these
8656,2.0, Don’t waste ur time buying these especially since people OVERHYPE THEM AND THINK UR ONLY COOL IF U HAVE AIRPODS AirPods suck
8657,5.0,I am so happy I bit the bullet and bought these
8658,5.0, The sound quality is great and they pair quite fast
8659,5.0, Great for runs and jogs
8660,5.0," I love being able to do them while washing dishes, etc"
8661,5.0, Also: make sure you are ordering directly from Amazon and NOT from a third party
8662,5.0," If you’re ordering from a third party seller, you run the risk of receiving fake ones"
8663,5.0, No one ordering who has Amazon prime or is ordering them directly from Amazon is going to receive “fake” airpods
8664,5.0, Be smart
8665,1.0,This is my 2nd pair of pods and the 2nd time that something has gone out on it
8666,1.0," Contacted Amazon and it was 7 days past their return policy so I had to contact APPLE, Contacted Apple and they set my up an appt for the ""GENIUS BAR"", Went at my appt time and still waited over an hour for someone to help, Per Genius Bar they are not sure why it is not working but would need to send it in to see what is wrong but it could take up to 3-4 wks"
8667,1.0, Absolute Garbage PODs and Amazon not taking care of Business customers just added fuel to this issue
8668,5.0,Got these on Prime day and I am glad I did
8669,5.0, They are the best way to listen to anything on my iPhone or iPad
8670,5.0, I bought them for the wireless feature which is amazing
8671,5.0, The sound quality is better than I expected
8672,5.0, They charge super fast and last for hours before needing a quick recharge
8673,5.0, The case stays charged longer than the buds so you just pop them in the case and get more juice
8674,5.0, I can’t wait to travel with them
8675,5.0,Got these for my son he loves them
8676,5.0, These are more of a status purchase rather than being the best option available
8677,5.0, I got a pair for my mother and she is able to use them with ease
8678,5.0, Good for fans of apple products works well with apple devices
8679,5.0, I personally use the galaxy buds plus and feel they are better
8680,5.0, But these are a solid buy apple makes a quality product
8681,5.0, Can't go wrong with them
8682,4.0,"At first I was a skeptic, no way was I paying $160 for a pair of earbuds; wireless or not"
8683,4.0, However I jumped on the recent sale and have not regretted it a single day
8684,4.0,I have dropped them in water by accident and they still work
8685,4.0," Durable, good sound quality"
8686,4.0, Noise cancellation could use work- people around you will hear what you’re listening to
8687,4.0,Price leaves room for improvement considering you can purchase fake ‘Airpods’ elsewhere for $20
8688,5.0,Air pods work great
8689,5.0, I can transition between all my Apple devices with ease
8690,5.0, Just love the sound quality
8691,5.0, Especially after a bad experience with a cheaper brand
8692,5.0,This is a product that most people have already but if you don’t have AirPods I would highly recommend them
8693,5.0, I was hasty towards buying them at first but now that I have them I can’t let go
8694,5.0," They have an amazing battery life, my AirPods were at 2% and then 5 minutes later after charging them they were at 34%"
8695,5.0," They are so lightweight, and just so easy to use"
8696,5.0," Although, they don’t have a great sound transparency, but if you want that then I would suggest getting the AirPods Pro because they have that feature"
8697,5.0, But there is some transparency depending on how loud you set the music volume
8698,5.0," Overall I love them and it’s such a great buy, definitely worth the money"
8699,4.0,These headphones look good and fit in ear well enough
8700,4.0, They do not create a seal around the ear
8701,4.0, The sound is good for what it is
8702,4.0, Compared to other headphones these are a lot easier and straightforward to connect and use with other apple products
8703,4.0, I think its a over priced for what you get and can get better quality from others brands at similar price ranges
8704,4.0, The time I have spent with the headphones they have proven to be reliable and easy to use and I do not regret my purchase
8705,5.0,My first pair and I love them I like how u can tap your ear piece and it change the song it’s definitely different from having the regular one I like that I can move around more esp having a special need child and 3 other kids it most definitely comes in handy only thing I don’t like it seems to fall out your ear at times so I would most definitely not use them if I have to use the bathroom wish they could fit tighter into the ear bud
8706,4.0,I guess the expensive price is to pay for the apple executives
8707,4.0, First sad that their only in white
8708,4.0, Gets dirty real fast
8709,4.0, There large pods and you have to find the best angle cause after an hour they hurt
8710,4.0, Sound quality could be better and volume isn’t as loud as I would desire
8711,4.0, I’ll skip the name brand and could find something better for less cost out there
8712,2.0,"At first I was so happy with this product, they worked great and made working out at the gym much easier without having a cord hanging getting in the way"
8713,2.0," However, after a couple months the battery life deteriorated"
8714,2.0, Rarely do both of the headphones sync together
8715,2.0, Usually I get one to work for about 5 minutes and then it dies again
8716,2.0, I am so disappointed as I saved up to buy these thinking they would be a worthwhile investment and they are NOT
8717,2.0," I took very good care of them, didnt over use them and they still only lasted a couple months"
8718,5.0,Great product again apple
8719,5.0, They work with Siri and they are very easy to use
8720,5.0, The only thing that I would change would be the size
8721,5.0, My ears are small and they hurt my ears a bit
8722,5.0, It would be great if they were padded a bit but for what they are and the inconvenient cord issue is solved
8723,5.0, Love the touch feature
8724,5.0, Also people can hear me very clearly
8725,1.0,One of the Airpods stopped working completely within a month for no reason
8726,1.0, I was a day or two out of the return window and Amazon were the useless money grubbing scumbags they always are and wouldn’t do a thing
8727,1.0, I basically have to pay full price to repair or replace them through Apple
8728,1.0, I despise this company so much
8729,1.0, I’m deleting my account and credit card
8730,5.0,I could not possibly be happier with these things
8731,5.0," I’ve only ever had a single hiccup with them, and I think it was the phone’s fault (couldn’t get them to ship to the next song)"
8732,5.0," I take phone calls well, they take speech to text dictation well, and the way they read texts back to you is really great"
8733,5.0," Plus, the fact that you can find even a single lost one is pretty awesome"
8734,2.0,Right airpod stopped working right after the 90 day period to return ended
8735,2.0, I was warned not to buy AirPods from Amazon so can’t say I wasn’t
8736,2.0, Now I have to deal with Apple’s awful warranty service to hopefully get it fixed/replaced
8737,4.0,I bought these because I always a wanted these 
8738,4.0, Price was reasonable so I jumped at them
8739,4.0," After receiving them , I didn’t hear much bass which I enjoy"
8740,4.0, And my cousin told me about the Pro model which had more features and noise cancelling
8741,4.0, 
8742,4.0, These are great AirPods for the price and sound great regardless
8743,5.0,I’ve been switching between wired headphones for my Mac laptop and iPhone since March when I realized my Mac wouldn’t stay connected to my non-Apple Bluetooth headphones and kept dropping during meetings
8744,5.0," When we went back to iPhones in July, it didn’t occur to me that AirPods would be the perfect solution because they’re made for switching between apple products"
8745,5.0, Silly me
8746,5.0," I’m actually looking forward to a week full of meetings, whether on my computer or phone"
8747,5.0,"Love, love, love them"
8748,5.0, I need to be quiet in the mornings while my husband is sleeping
8749,5.0, It's so nice to be released from the earbud cord
8750,5.0, I also prefer the airbuds to my ear/phone hands free device
8751,5.0, These are better sound and more comfortable
8752,5.0, I was a bit surprised at the cost but I use them daily so I decided it was reasonable for my situation
8753,5.0," In hindsight, I'd recommend them to everyone so matter how often you may use them"
8754,5.0, I love them
8755,1.0,"Had it for only about 6-7 months, and the case no longer charges, but stay at 0%"
8756,1.0," The earbuds seem to be charging, but they only hold power for a few hours"
8757,1.0," May be aberration, but a big disappointment given the limited period of time it has been used…"
8758,1.0,Apple support has been disappointing too
8759,5.0,I finally ditched my bose headphones since I felt like they looked unprofessional at work and I couldn't really use them in the car or for exercising
8760,5.0, I love the wear these when I workout
8761,5.0," I'm also much safer in my car now, I pop one in for my commute in case I want to use siri or pick up a call"
8762,5.0, The battery life is pretty good
8763,5.0, I make it a few days at work using these 6 hrs a day before I have to charge the case
8764,5.0,"I have a sudden hearing loss that was scheduled for surgery but with the delta variant this summer, it was postponed"
8765,5.0, I use the AirPods to hear virtual meetings and phone calls and listen to live conversations and meetings in person via Live Listen on my iPhone
8766,5.0, They do a fantastic job of giving me hearing functionality that I had been lacking
8767,5.0,"I just came here to say I've tried 3 other brands of ""airpod"" types of ear phones, all in an effort to avoid paying for the genuine Apple product"
8768,5.0," Cutting to the chase, all of the others pale in comparison in just about every aspect"
8769,5.0," Sound quality, connectivity to Apple devices, battery life"
