6000	4.0	At first I thought you had to connect the headphones before you take them out of the charging pod but that was just my stupidity haha	1
6001	5.0	I purchased two sets of these	1
6002	5.0	One for my husband and one for myself to use for teaching online	1
6003	5.0	The AirPods are clear, the microphone pics up well	1
6004	5.0	I've used it to help with amplification while doing live video and although it doesn't replace external auto mics it does help amplify my voice enough that people can hear me	1
6005	5.0	My husband had another microphone/earpiece to use for teaching his online classes and has told me over and over how much better the AirPods are	1
6006	4.0	I was reluctant to join the bandwagon of Airpod users	0
6006	4.0	I'm happy I made the switch since my PowerBeats and Revjams both died out	1
6007	4.0	If you want noise cancelling, go for Revjams Active Pro	0
6008	4.0	Could literally ride my back down the highway without the sound of cars destroying my music	1
6009	4.0	However, the Airpods have been absolutely excellent with the ease of connectivity with your bluetooth device, accessing Siri (can customize double-tap function on either airpod to access Siri, skip tracks, pause, etc), and charging	1
6010	4.0	It seems like 15 minutes of charging them in the case gets them back up to 100%, which probably lasts about 3 hours of play time	1
6011	4.0	Overall, I'm really glad my wife got me these for my birthday Jan 2020	1
6012	4.0	Would NOT go back to RevJams or BeatsPowerless	0
6013	4.0	I’ve wanted the AirPods for months so when I received these as a Christmas gift from my parents I was ecstatic	1
6014	4.0	It was fairly easy syncing the AirPods to my iPhone 7Plus via Bluetooth	1
6015	4.0	I tried both pods on right away, the sound quality was surprisingly great and they were pretty comfortable too	1
6016	4.0	After a few hours (roughly 2) they started to get uncomfortable making my ear itch which then made me realize why I never used the headphones that originally came with the iPhone	0
6017	4.0	I had no idea Apple also has the AirPod Pros which look more comfortable so if you want comfort I’d highly recommend stop looking at these and head over to the AirPod Pros	1
6018	4.0	They also don’t allow you to go very far from your phone	0
6019	4.0	I had my phone sitting on the coffee table in my living room, I walked out front to take out the trash and the music started to get staticky going in and out	0
6020	4.0	Only plus is being able to charge my phone and still listen to my music	1
6021	2.0	They worked well for about 15 months but then the left one failed	0
6022	2.0	I took them to the Apple store and was told they are just outside of warranty and repair would be $70	0
6023	2.0	Pretty disappointing	0
6024	2.0	I used them a lot for video conference calls— the ear piece batteries would last for about 3-hours in calls between charges	0
6025	2.0	Recharged very quickly in the case	1
6026	2.0	Again, pretty decent but sucks they failed so soon	0
6027	4.0	Works great with all our Apple devices, nice and seamless connection	1
6030	4.0	With aftermarket accessories the Airpods work great for just about any occasion	1
6031	4.0	I love then for work cause I can still hear just fine with my music low if someone needs to talk to me	1
6032	4.0	Battery in the case needs charging often with normal use which is not a huge deal	1
6032	4.0	I find myself with dead earphone all to often as the case doesnt stay charged very long between uses	0
6033	5.0	Sound quality is awesome	1
6033	5.0	This is my second purchase, I had gotten one for my husband and now I got this one for me	1
6034	5.0	My husband haves no complaints, me in the other hand, think that the headphones are a little loose sometimes and have to be fixing it so it doesn’t fall from my ear, but it’s not that bad, I love the clarity of my calls and music , it gets charged super fast	1
6035	5.0	Very happy with my purchase	1
6036	4.0	I got caught up with the hype/trend of the airpods	1
6037	4.0	And there are good reason why it is popular	1
6038	4.0	The first thing is the convenience of quickly and easily pairing with your phone or even computer	1
6039	4.0	In terms of sound quality, the airpods doesn't sound at all different from the regular apple earpods	0
6040	4.0	Essentially it is basically bluetooth earpods with the siri assistance built in	1

6043	4.0	The mic is okay	1
6043	4.0	I used it once and it sounds muddle when I tried it to record	0
6044	4.0	One of the biggest plus using airpods is not having to deal with TANGLED WIRES	1
6045	4.0	The airpods have great battery life and it charges really quick	1
6046	4.0	I would say using airpods for around 4 hours leaves it around 70-80% on the airpods it self	1
6047	4.0	Last thing to mention is the price tag, yes it is expensive	0
6047	4.0	If you're someone who wants no bells or whistle and want a good reliable product, and is okay with the price tag then go with this	1
6048	4.0	Yes there are other headphones that offer more features and maybe even cheaper price	0
6049	4.0	However, It is kind of hard to beat something this easy to use and part of the meme	1
6050	4.0	So it is a great buy	1
6051	1.0	Checked the serial number on Apple’s website and it says these are legit	1
6052	1.0	But wonder if I got some counterfeits	0
6053	1.0	Why do people say these are so good	0
6054	1.0	The audio quality is horrible compared to the plug in airbuds that you get with your iPhone	0
6055	1.0	And the voice quality is abysmal	0
6056	1.0	I got these specifically for Zoom and Teams calls on my Mac book and people say they can barely hear me	0
6057	1.0	I make calls from my iPhone XS with these and the same issue	0
6058	1.0	I got on sale for $130 but that is till to much for these useless headphones	0
6059	1.0	Going back to the free plug in ear buds	0

6081	5.0	I have tiny ears	0
6081	5.0	They either ache constantly or fall out	0
6082	5.0	These do neither of those things	0
6083	5.0	Suck it up, buy them	1
6084	5.0	And definitely buy them a little case with a carabiner	1
6085	5.0	They live on my car keys and I use them a ton	1
6086	3.0	The green light letting you know they have charged doesn't work	0
6087	3.0	They fit well in the ears, comfortable	1
6088	3.0	The battery life of the case goes down quicker than the ear buds themselves	0
6089	3.0	But the battery life altogether didn’t last 1, 3-hour plane ride	0
6091	3.0	I need them now so no time to ship back, get new ones, blah blah…they are fine for now	0
6092	3.0	I will purchase my next set directly from Apple so that I know they are authentic and will work correctly	1
6094	5.0	At first I wasn't a fan of wireless airpods	0
6095	5.0	I thought they were douchy and people walking around with them seemed to reflect that	1
6096	5.0	I am a true hard-wired headphone type of guy	1
6097	5.0	While I enjoy most Apple products, these are phenomenal	1
6098	5.0	I am a true audiophile and the quality of sound is very good	1
6099	5.0	I saw these priced at the Apple Store for $199, but for a bit less on Amazon, they are worth the price	0
6100	5.0	I added this to my arsenal of devices I carry and I don't mind to have yet another thing to charge and keep track of	1
6101	5.0	The AirPods also are very comfortable and emit a sound when you insert them into your ear	1
6102	5.0	The SIRI activation is also pleasant and nice	1
6103	5.0	Overall I recommend these for those who enjoy great sound quality and convenience	1
6104	3.0	I came into them all hyped	0
6105	3.0	Watched some reviews on YouTube but kept my hopes up	1

6112	3.0	My Beats sound better but AirPods are more portable	0
6113	3.0	Guess my daughter is getting an early present	1
6114	3.0	Knocking off two stars due to concerns over long term reliability	0
6115	3.0	I've noticed they have issues connecting to my iPhone	0
6115	3.0	The battery life seems to be shortening at a much faster rate than I anticipated	0
6116	3.0	Like the title says, these earbuds are awesome	0
6117	3.0	They integrate seamlessly with both my iPhone and Mac and I can easily switch between them with no loss in functionality	1
6118	3.0	As for sound quality, they do well in that department	1
6119	3.0	They sound very similarly to the wired Apple earbuds, and along that same vain, they also fit like them too	1
6119	3.0	If the regular Apple earbuds don't fit well, these won't be much different from that	0
6120	3.0	In all, these wireless earbuds are great	1
6121	1.0	I received these headphones as a Christmas gift from a relative	1
6122	1.0	My first choice have not been Apple AirPods but Beats	0
6123	1.0	However, accepting a free gift is always fun	1
6124	1.0	UNTIL you get fake Apple headphones from a third party vendor on Amazon	0
6125	1.0	On the first connect, everything seemed fine	1
6126	1.0	I sat them down for a second and went to use them again	0
6127	1.0	My phone started freezing and glitching	0
6128	1.0	When I attempted to turn my phone off bc my phone would not disconnect from them	0
6128	1.0	I had an extremely hard time	0
6129	1.0	I connected them to another device and they did the same thing	1
6130	1.0	I went into the Apple store here recently and discovered that the serial number on the box as listed in the photo have been reprinted on tons of Apple made boxes by the third party host using “true” Apple AirPods serial numbers	0
6131	1.0	They showed me the list	1
6132	1.0	This is highly disappointing and discrediting to Apple and also Amazon	0
6133	1.0	If you purchase anything with a name brand on it especially Apple, please take your products to the main distributor to have them vip firm that you have made a legit purchase if you care about the quality of your product	0
6134	1.0	I will not be removing my review	1
6135	1.0	Please handle this accordingly	0
6136	3.0	I was so happy with these until I got my first notification	1
6137	3.0	They almost blew out my eardrums	0
6138	3.0	Researched and found the only thing you can do about this is to toggle the ""change with buttons"" under ""sounds"" on the iPhone	0
6139	3.0	This will take care of the problem UNLESS you change your volume in any other app and then it just reverts back to the ridiculously loud notifications (text, door camera, call, etc	0
6140	3.0	I need to decide if the convenience of using Siri with these things is worth my long-term hearing or if I should just send them back	0
6141	1.0	It will work for like a month but then one side stops working	0
6142	1.0	Before purchasing, I saw some other reviewers having the same issue but I hesitated to listen to them and went ahead with the purchase	0
6143	1.0	Now, I’m realizing that I should’ve listened to them	0
6144	1.0	I want to return it	0
6144	1.0	Get at least partial refund but that’s not possible before my return window has closed	0
6145	1.0	I wouldn’t recommend anyone to buy this	0
6146	1.0	What’s really disturbing is that it’s an amazon choice, which makes it sounds like it’s the original and quality version of an apple product you’re buying but instead this piece of crap is nothing but disappointment and regrets	0
6147	5.0	Sound better than I expected and very convenient	1
6148	5.0	My only complaint is that when I ordered it said I would get the latest version (AirPod 2 with H1 chip) and I received the first version AirPod	0
6149	5.0	This is not a big deal as there is apparently not much difference but I thought I would get the latest version	1
6150	5.0	Not worth going through the retuen process dealing with the Chatbot	0
6151	5.0	Update 4/5/2020 - Checked serial number and Apple says they are AirPod 2	1
6152	5.0	But it did come with the older wired charging case (I did order the wired charging case) which I don't see as a big deal although the LED on the exterior does seem a little better	0
6153	5.0	Happy with sound quality and microphone quality	1
6154	5.0	I'm upping my review to 5 stars	1
6155	5.0	Good quality product, good price, good delivery time	1
6157	1.0	These definitely belonged to someone before landing in my hands	0
6158	1.0	When I paired them it said Rita’s AirPods	0
6159	1.0	There was only two pieces of tape on the outside box and it was dirty	0
6160	1.0	The quality was terrible and the left headphone stopped working	0
6161	1.0	It’s things like this that really discourage me from ordering online	0
6163	1.0	Shameful, Amazon	0
6165	1.0	I’m a huge Apple fanboy and feel that I should have known better but didn’t notice where the charging light was until after I received them	0
6167	5.0	I didn’t know what I was missing	0
6168	5.0	I walk a couple of miles each morning and had been using corded earbuds, which I all too often would accidentally catch my hand on, or not have enough length to carry my phone in a pocket	1
6169	5.0	These eliminated those issues	1
6170	5.0	I am also working remotely and have several ZOOM meetings a week	1
6171	5.0	I have started using the Air Pods for those as well	1
6172	5.0	They’re great for working in the yard without having to keep phone in hand or pocket	1
6173	5.0	Sound is very good	1
6174	5.0	Charge time is as advertised and recharge time is quick	1
6175	5.0	Like it so much	1
6176	5.0	I can absolutely say great quality, I did two times accidents laundry with it	1
6177	5.0	After I pick them up from washer machine , I was afraid of dead AirPods	0
6178	5.0	But they still work well and perfect sounds quality	1
6179	5.0	I use it every day during working or housework, never bother my ears, can hang on all day on my ears	1
6180	5.0	You can see some satraches on my AirPods , you will see how often I use them	1
6181	5.0	In short, great product from Apple	1
6183	5.0	Never disappoint, recommend it to people who wants earphones	1
6184	5.0	These airpods are not just attractive but do exactly as they say: they allow you to get a clear sound while blocking out the outside noice	1
6185	5.0	My nephew wanted them, so I thought they were worth the investment	1
6186	5.0	The charging case is a nice touch, and they are easy to travel with	1
6187	5.0	The added bonus for us was that they arrived almost a week earlier than expected	1
6188	5.0	Great quality and service	1
6189	5.0	How could anyone dislike Apple AirPods	1
6191	5.0	Talk about sound quality, it’s unbelievable	1
6192	5.0	I just cannot get over the phenomenal quality of sound	1
6193	5.0	They come in a nice case and charger to plug into your usb outlet	1
6194	5.0	They charge in no time	1
6195	5.0	The AirPods are also smart	1
6196	5.0	Immediately connects to your phone through bluetooth	1
6197	5.0	You take one out and they immediately turn off but you still have the option to listen with one in the ear	1
6198	5.0	As soon as you open the cute little case they connect immediately to your phone	1
6199	5.0 	Best Apple investment ever	1
6200	5.0	Been waiting and contemplating for a long time on whether to spend more than $100 on wireless AirPods	1
6201	5.0	After tripping on my headphone cable and having my phone almost fall into a creek, I decided to take the leap	1
6203	5.0	Battery life is incredible	1
6204	5.0	Even more incredible is the time the AirPods take to recharge once you put them to charge in the charged case	1
6205	5.0	Holy super speed charging	1
6206	5.0	It literally feels like it takes less than 2 to 3 minutes to charge them from 10% to 100%	1
6207	5.0	Best product I have purchased on Amazon so far	1
6208	5.0	I would highly recommend buying a case for your AirPods as soon as you get them	1
6211	2.0	After a long time putting off this purchase because I was unsure whether they would pair well with my Galaxy phone, I finally relented	1
6212	2.0	Only to be disappointed	0
6213	2.0	The Bluetooth pairing often drops or is sketchy	0
6214	2.0	When that happens, I have to carry my phone close to my ears to catch the signal	0
6215	2.0	Which, essentially, eliminates the need for the earbuds	0
6216	2.0	When I went to return them, Amazon offered tech support	1
6217	2.0	Which was great because it fixed the problem for about 2 days	0
6219	2.0	But by the time I got back around to returning them, the window had closed	0
6220	2.0	Very disappointed that I'm now stuck with a lightly used product I can't return	0
6221	5.0	I only put one star on noise cancellation since these are more for like sound awareness	0
6222	5.0	I like it because you can hear things around you but music quality is still good	1
6223	5.0	Sometimes I even think my phone is playing the music and not the actual headphones	1
6225	5.0	Works with non apple products as well	1
6226	4.0	These air pods have surprisingly good battery life and are really comfortable to wear	1
6227	4.0	I primarily use my air pods during work	1
6228	4.0	So probably 5-8 hours a work day	1
6229	4.0	I use them intermittently due to having to interact with my coworkers	1
6230	4.0	I charge them every time I have to give someone my attention	1
6231	4.0	As a result of that I've never ran out of battery life in a single day	1
6232	4.0	I also find them extremely comfortable, like I forget they are even there sometimes if I paused my audiobook	1
6233	4.0	While I don't exercise with them, I haven't had one fall out yet during regular use	0
6234	4.0	But I am cautious enough to not use them around water as I fear they might fall out and be damaged in such circumstances	1
6235	4.0	Unfortunately, we are only allowed one earbud in while we work	1
6236	4.0	Some areas of my workspace are loud due primarily to large AC units and conveyors converging in certain areas	0
6237	4.0	Due to this, I do have one complaint about them	0
6238	4.0	They don't cancel noise very well	0
6239	4.0	I used to have another pair of wireless ear buds and they were much better at cancelling out sound, even with one ear	0
6240	4.0	As a result I am frequently having to pause my audiobook in these areas as I don't want to blow out one of my eardrums trying to overpower the external sounds with raising the volume of my device	0
6241	4.0	As to regards about sound quality, I find them good for my purposes	1
6242	4.0	Listening to podcasts and audiobooks in standard quality	1
6243	4.0	I have decent headphones at home if I want an audiophile experience with high quality audio formats especially with music, games, and shows	1
6244	4.0	But the air pods don't necessarily sound terrible	1
6245	4.0	They are just a little annoying to pair between my iphone and pc back and forth	0
6247	4.0	As I only use them while I work, I don't take calls, so I can't comment on the sound receiving end of the earbuds and their use as a headset	1
6248	4.0	Overall I think they are pretty great product	1
6249	4.0	I did receive the newest model, it was factory sealed and did not appear to have been used	0
6250	4.0	I read a couple of bad reviews and I was particularly worried about receiving a previous model or returned item sold as new	0
6251	4.0	Thankfully everything was fine	1
6252	5.0	They charge super fast	1
6253	5.0	They last for about 4 hours if on consistently	1
6254	5.0	If you have braids or any type of heavy hair, be careful because it will try to knock them out of your ears	0
6255	5.0	The sound is weird sometimes	0
6256	5.0	It will sound clogged up or it will make it sound more digital	0
6257	5.0	This only happened to me when I opened certain apps	0
6258	5.0	Apps that have ads or music in the background already	0
6259	5.0	The AirPods have trouble processing that I suppose they connect super easy to your phone like barely any set up	1
6261	5.0	I would say to beware of connecting the AirPods to another device that’s not apple	0
6262	5.0	It works but it is difficult to connect them back to your iPhone after you do that	0
6263	5.0	I had to google it	0
6264	5.0	That’s what the small button is for on it	1
6265	5.0	Other than that I think it’s worth the purchase	1
6266	5.0	I held off on the airpods because they just looked strange, not to mention how people looked wearing them	0
6266	5.0	I worried they would fall out and I would lose one but those concerns haven't really happened	1
6267	5.0	They fit well, the sound quality is great and you adjust really quick	1
6268	5.0	I also like the solid-ness of them and their case	1
6269	5.0	They don't feel flimsy like some I have seen which isn't a surprise with Apple quality	1
6270	5.0	I ended up getting second pair for gift for sister and she loves them too	1
6271	5.0	Good investment and I LOVE not dealing with headphone wires	1
6272	5.0	These work great	1
6273	5.0	No static like other brands I've tried	1
6274	5.0	People can actually hear me clearly on phone calls	1
6275	5.0	The distance was amazing at first	1
6275	5.0	After about a week it started breaking up if I was more than 30 feet from the phone	0
6276	5.0	Good enough	1
6277	5.0	It's held charge well	1
6278	5.0	I have an Android phone and it connects well	1
6279	5.0	It changes between my phone and computer decently also	1
6280	5.0	Oh, they're also comfortable	1
6283	5.0	I've only used them for calls and the computer	1
6284	5.0	I haven't tried running with them	1
6285	5.0	They stay in my ear and don't move around and don't hurt	1
6286	5.0	My wife listens to or reads books constantly when she’s not sewing a quilt or taking care of the grand-babies	1
6287	5.0	She had an off-brand Bluetooth set of air buds but couldn’t get them to pair with each other	1
6288	5.0	Both would pair separately with her iPhone but not both	1
6289	5.0	She took these out of the charging container and like magic they paired instantly with each other and to her phone	1
6291	5.0	What a difference buying original Apple airpods made	1
6292	5.0	No comparison at all	1
6293	5.0	Thanks Apple	1
6294	1.0	These AirPods were great until they weren't	0
6296	1.0	I have been using them just fine and about a week ago out of nowhere they just stopped connecting to my iPhone	0
6297	1.0	I'll get a connection maybe once every 5 tries	0
6297	1.0	I get a weird tinny sound with no bass and then have to try to reconnect again and again	0
6298	1.0	Of course, the return window has closed	0
6299	1.0	Really disappointed and don't know what to do with them now	0
6300	5.0	I actually really like these headphones for the ease of being able to multi task w/o a cord always attached	1
6301	5.0	Going to the gym and doing intense workouts with minimal adjusting	1
6302	5.0	My only complaint is that battery life	0
6303	5.0	As an write this review at 10:15 am, batteries previously charged to 100%, only using to answer calls, my ear buds currently sit at 54%	0
6304	5.0	You’d think with these being the hottest buds on the market, the battery life would be impeccable	1
6305	5.0	Slightly disappointed in that, overall pleased	0
6307	5.0	I bought these to replace my Jaybird Freedoms and thought I'd be trading sound quality for convivence and was willing to settle for that	1
6308	5.0	I assumed these would be easy to set up, would turn on and off seamlessly and give me great features, and I assumed they would sound sub par compared to the Jaybirds	0
6309	5.0	I was right on two of those assumptions	1
6310	5.0	The sound quality is in fact on par with Jaybirds	1
6311	5.0	If I have to nitpick they aren't as comfortable as the Jaybirds, but that's not saying they are uncomfortable	1
6312	5.0	At first I wasn't sure if I should order since some reviewers claimed to get fake AirPods	0
6313	5.0	I went ahead an ordered them a day ago and got them in the mail today	1
6314	5.0	So far I am enjoying them	1
6315	5.0	The package was still wrapped properly when I received it	1
6316	5.0	I went ahead and checked the serial number on the AirPod box on the Apple website and it came back as authentic 2nd generation AirPods	1
6317	5.0	A lot of other people stated they got used AirPods, mine came wrapped properly in the plastic just like they where at the apple store and had all the proper instructions and charger	1
6318	5.0	No sign of being used	1
6319	5.0	I would say if you are considering them they are a great deal, considering you will save $30 buying here vs the apple store	1
6320	5.0	I debated getting a pair of these as I thought I was content with the pair of earbuds that come with the phone but I’m super glad I purchased these	1
6321	5.0	First of all I feel like these were a wonderful price compared to apple and even as a refurbished product these are amazing	1
6322	5.0	The sound quality is amazing	1
6322	5.0	I love not having a cord dangling around having to deal with	1
6323	5.0	They easily pair with apple devices	1
6323	5.0	I haven’t tried pairing with a non apple Bluetooth device it’s supposed to be easy as well	1
6324	5.0	There’s a button the case you press to pair with a non apple Bluetooth device which is convenient	1
6326	5.0	They constantly Stay charged in the case and I have only had to charge the case a couple times in the few months I’ve had these	0
6327	5.0	Very convenient and definitely worth purchasing if you’re on the fence	1
6328	1.0	These disconnect frequently, normally just the left one	0
6329	1.0	I have tried everything from disconnecting and reconnecting, turning off ear detect, disconnecting all other Bluetooth devices, and many more nothing helps	0
6331	1.0	These are the worst headphones I’ve ever had the displeasure of purchasing	0
6332	1.0	they’re EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE, do yourself a favor and get a better brand that isn’t overpriced	0
6334	5.0	Having owned both of them apple AirPods vs galaxy buds, not the pro versions of both	1
6334	5.0	I can say that the noise cancellation is better in galaxy buds but the quality of the sound from AirPods is out of the world	1
6338	5.0	Charging is better in AirPods vs galaxy buds, I use it for like 10 mins at a time and it lasts for a day if not less	1
6340	5.0	Taking off one star because you can still hear noises after wearing this, if you want total cancellation upgrade to the pro version	0
6342	5.0	Personally, I don't find much use in using a wireless charging one compared to a wired one	1
6343	3.0	I don’t know if I received counterfeit AirPods or if Apple has cut the quality of the product in the last couple years	0
6343	3.0	the product I received is very inferior to the 2017 models I replaced	0
6344	3.0	The case is lighter	0
6344	3.0	the lid feels light and flimsy, as if it could be twisted off	0
6345	3.0	The pods themselves feel and sound identical to the old ones, but these cut out frequently	0
6346	3.0	The left one will cut and the right one continues on	0
6347	5.0	This is a wonderful product that I am very impressed with	1
6349	5.0	Connects flawlessly to my iPhone	1
6351	5.0	Sound quality is great	1
6352	5.0	Works beautifully with the Pandora app	1
6353	5.0	Will take calls seamlessly and resume music afterward	1
6354	5.0	The earbuds fit and stay in well enough to go rucking for several hours	1
6355	5.0	Feels like a quality product that was well made and thought out	1
6356	5.0	I initially hated the shift Apple made when it removed headphone jacks	0
6357	5.0	I have to say, after finally making the shift due to the price drop to ~$120, I bought 2 pair for my wife and I	1
6358	5.0	We love them, we use them all the time and can't recommend them highly enough	1
6359	5.0	My wife jams to the tunes during the day	1
6360	5.0	I keep one in my ear while teleworking for conference calls made easy	1
6361	5.0	Very seamless, and the sound quality is phenomenal - microphone included	1
6362	3.0	Waited a good 5 day’s to write a review as I wanted to give them an honest chance	1
6364	3.0	I will say the sound quality isn’t bad	1
6365	3.0	It’s not the best I’ve heard but for wireless headphones there’s not a static in the background like some of the cheaper models	0
6366	3.0	The double tap feature is a little strange as it takes a bit to find that perfect spot	0
6367	3.0	 Also it’s double tap being pause and fast forward I haven’t been able to ge the music to skip forward only pause	0
6368	3.0	 So that feature I haven’t used all that much	0
6369	3.0	 They do slip a bit in your ears so I recommend buying the ear hooks	0
6370	3.0	 I bought them and they work pretty well with them	0
6371	3.0	 There’s also silicon options for covers to help the slipping	1
6372	3.0	 I’d also recommend a case for the charging case as it’s quite small and kinda slippery	0
6373	3.0	 So all in all I think they’re a decent pair of headphones	1
6374	3.0	 Just don’t go into the purchase expecting perfection	0
6375	3.0	I like these headphones because of the convenience it provides, especially around the house	1
6376	3.0	 It makes cooking while watching videos on my phone super easy	1
6377	3.0	 I love making important calls using my AirPods	1
6378	3.0	 The only thing that I don’t like is that when I am on the train during my commute, you can’t hear clearly even if the volume is loud (which can damage your ears)	0
6379	3.0	 So if this is going to be a huge investment for you and sound quality is important, I would say get some beats or other better headphones	0
6380	3.0	 I can’t listen to podcasts on the train because you hear the train over the audio	0
6384	1.0	 Yeah the sound quality is great IF they work, I’m bummed at all the high reviews for these because they’re made cheaply and without care or concern for the product	0
6385	1.0	 I shouldn’t spend top dollar on a top dollar device for it to act like dollar store headphones	0
6386	1.0	 I’m dissatisfied and disappointed at the terrible quality of this worthless product	0
6387	4.0	I've bought 3 pairs now	1
6388	4.0	 The first two were eaten by the dog at different points in time and therefore needed to be replaced	0
6389	4.0	 The sound quality is decent, but I don't have anything to compare it to	1
6391	4.0	 The latest pair cuts in and out for no discernible reason	0
6392	4.0	 reasonably priced considering my dog will likely chew thru them again in the future	1
6393	3.0	I love my airpods and have been using them for some time now	1
6394	3.0	 I've never had an issue until recently where one airpod never seems to charge in the case despite the case being fully charged	0
6395	3.0	 I don't know why this happened all of a sudden this past month	0
6396	3.0	 Its incredibly frustrating when I put them in and one seems to have charged perfectly and the other one is at 0%	0
6399	3.0	I bought these I thought as an alternative to more expensive Apple AirPods and was I wrong	0
6400	3.0	 I used them solely with my IPad and the sound bounces periodically from one ear to the other losing sound in the other ear	0
6401	3.0	 This is an occasional occurrence but annoying enough to be unhappy	0
6402	3.0	 When I first tried using them with my Android phone they wouldn’t stay connected and I had to carry my case with me	0
6403	3.0	 I don’t recommend buying these	0
6406	5.0	Christmas gift for my daughter- was exactly what she wanted	1
6407	5.0	 Opened the case cover and immediately her phone asked to pair with these	1
6408	5.0	 Installation could not be any easier	1
6409	5.0	 Love that these are genuine Apple products as I can be sure that they will work correctly with the other Apple products that we already own and use daily	1
6410	5.0	 I have always found Apple quality and engineering to be exceptional, and service when having an issue to be top-notch	1
6411	5.0	 These were a great value	1
6412	1.0	I love the product and used it regularly	1
6413	1.0	 it worked perfectly, however after 3 months I noticed one day that it kept connecting and disconnecting	0
6414	1.0	 When it finally worked, music played in only the right airpod	0
6415	1.0	 I troubleshooted the issue and reset the airpods, forgot the device and even resetted my phone	0
6416	1.0	 It wasn’t an issue with my phone but for some reason the device wasn’t even showing up in Bluetooth devices	0
6417	1.0	 I called apple support and they told me to do the same thing I did, in fact there was nothing they could do for me to fix it	0
6418	1.0	 It doesn’t connect to any other iphone and would not appear in non apple phones	0
6419	1.0	 Do not buy this product without knowing there could be risks	0
6420	1.0	 If you happen to have a faulty airpod, even with a warranty, you wont be able to use it ever again	0
6422	1.0	 There no physical damage so I dont understand the problem	0
6423	1.0	 Please be aware that if your airpods have internal errors, you are screwed	0
6426	1.0	I am so upset with this purchase	0
6427	1.0	 I bought them thinking it was a great deal so something that was in fair condition	0
6428	1.0	 When I received the headphones I didn’t open them right away as I was busy planning my daughters birthday	0
6429	1.0	 When I finally opened them the airpods wouldn’t connect to my phone for some reason	0
6430	1.0	 After extensive research as to why they were f charging or connecting I found out that the AirPods inside the case were switched out and the AirPods were fake which is why I wasn’t holding any charge or connecting to my phone	0
6431	1.0	 I was so upset because I lost my money given that the window for return passed and was given an fauly product	0
6432	1.0	 Be careful when ordering these headphones and check them as soon as you buy them so you are able to return if needed	0
6433	1.0	 So upsetting to received a fake product	0
6434	1.0	 Amazon should really check for authenticity upon product returns like this	0
6435	5.0	Like this so much , got it from black sale for saving 30 bucks	1
6436	5.0	 After a simple a tap setup,it’s automatically connected with my iPhone and always on	1

6450	5.0	I was a skeptic for so long but the slim profile and ease of use without chords I will never go back to wires	1
6451	5.0	 They pair instantly if you’re lazy like me that’s awesome and I can’t really speak to quality	1
6452	5.0	 They aren’t going to vibrate your ears with the bass but for podcasts and your average music listener they are perfect	1
6453	5.0	 Anyone who is on the phone for work a lot will love these as well	1
6454	5.0	 Very fast charging as well	1
6456	5.0	 They are quite expensive so I would only recommend if you use Bluetooth headphones heavily already	1
6457	5.0	I’m pretty pleased with these AirPods	1
6458	5.0	 I wasn’t expecting greatness I just wanted to be able to listen to music while I charged my phone	1

6462	5.0	 I like them a lot but it really is just headphones without cords so don’t expect much more	0
6463	3.0	I was worried they wouldn’t stay in my ear as well- but Working in the medical field, I don’t have any issues with them falling out	0
6464	3.0	 They can have some difficulties with adjusting to just one headphone taken out and listening in the other still, as the headphones think you’re putting them away and you have to reconnect the Bluetooth	0
6465	3.0	 Overall though they work great, I can answer phone calls while doing dishes, or talk on the phone while driving and have no worries about accidents	1

6560	1.0	 So much for brand new, unopened product	0
6561	1.0	 I had so much trouble figuring out how to use the product because the product documentation was so small I had to use a magnifying glass too read it	0

6570	1.0	Do NOT buy this	0
6571	5.0	These were cheaper to order on Amazon then ordering from Apple	1
6572	5.0	 My daughter loves these	1

6575	5.0	If you are leaning towards getting these then DO IT	1

6578	5.0	 So I decided to get the real ones	1
6579	5.0	 I was seeing great reviews so I bought them and then it offered me Apple Care+ which I did purchase	1
6580	5.0	 Thats when I was getting really nervous because I was seeing all the bad reviews of people getting used ones and scratched ones	1
6581	5.0	 I even seen a review where someone said they couldn't connect them and only one worked, which was what I was afraid of	0
6582	5.0	 Well I looked on my amazon order after it had shipped and it gave me a serial number	1
6583	5.0	 I checked it with apple and it was indeed an apple product	1
6584	5.0	 Still a little worried at that point	1
6585	5.0	 I got home that day and opened the amazon box and was very happy that it was in a sealed package and very brand new	1
6586	5.0	 I was very hopeful since I bought the Apple Care+ there was no way it wasn't legit	1

6596	5.0	 But now I have an iPhone XR, an iPad and now Airpods and I am so happy that I caved in and bought them	1
6597	5.0	 If I could give 10 stars I would	1

6599	5.0	 And just make sure you are buying from Apple and not a third party	1
6600	5.0	 If they offer you an Apple Care+ then it is legit from Apple	1
6602	5.0	Best Christmas gift	1

6609	5.0	 the case charges the pods quick and the case charges fully in like 10 minutes with them inside	1
6610	5.0	 GREAT buy, especially with Prime Day prices	1
6611	5.0	 Only issue is they don’t seem to cancel as much noise	0
6612	5.0	 Maybe because of some of the tech lime automatically pausing when one comes out kinda thing	0
6614	5.0	 Also when you get sweaty you have to pay more attention because they slide a little easier but overall an amazing upgrade to my wired ones	0
6616	4.0	 I was very excited and happy the first few months	1
6617	4.0	 Last two months I noticed that the battery ran very short	0
6618	4.0	 As matter of fact I use it much less these days and wonder if it’s genuine APPLE product	0
6619	4.0	 Very disappointed as for now	0
6620	4.0	 Back in summer I spent lot of time in gardening, listening to music and podcast	1
6621	4.0	 Now I only use for few phone calls	0
6622	4.0	 I would like the seller to contact me to see if a replacement can be granted	1
6623	4.0	 Otherwise I’ll need a new one	1
6624	4.0	Thank you for listening	1
6625	4.0	Good sound quality	1
6626	4.0	 I can just tap on it to play it but I haven't found a way how to pause it using just a tap	0
6628	4.0	 This one I like it much as no echo issue and able to hear each other quite well with good quality as well	1
6629	4.0	 Not all ear-buds fits well in my ear, but and this one too doesn't fit very well for long time, but for short duration it fits well	1
6630	4.0	 I am sure the issue must be with my ear, and nothing wrong with this product	1
6631	4.0	 It is a good quality ear-bud	1
6633	1.0	 I received one Apple AirPod (left ear) and an off brand (right ear)	0
6634	1.0	 I knew something wasn’t right when it kept disconnecting from Bluetooth	0
6635	1.0	 I usually wear one pod at a time but I put them both in my ear at the same time and noticed that one was longer than the other	0
6638	1.0	 I will never purchase from this seller again	0
6639	5.0	I didn't want to ""pay the price"" for authentic airpods and I tried off brands and other types but none are as good as the real thing	1
6640	5.0	I like these better than the 3rd generation because I don't like the ""squishy"" noise cancellation ear piece because I like to be able to hear alittle bit while I am walking	1
6641	5.0	 These sound good and the batteries last a long time	1
6643	1.0	These WERE amazing	1
6644	1.0	 Then out of no where the left microphone stopped working and no one could hear me	0
6645	1.0	 Then a few months later the right microphone stopped working	0
6645	1.0	 I couldn’t use them to talk to anyone	0
6646	1.0	 both have completely stopped working	0
6646	1.0	 I can’t use them to talk on the phone	0
6646	1.0	 I can’t even listen to music on them anymore	0
6647	1.0	 ABSOLUTE garbage for 150 bucks	0
6648	1.0	 Buyer beware and look elsewhere	0
6649	5.0	I always told myself I wouldn't get these because they looked so stupid	0
6649	5.0	I broke down one day and tried them out	1
6650	5.0	I'll never go back	1
6651	5.0	 They are so easy to connect	1
6652	5.0	 I was worried they would fall out of my ear easily but they don't	1
6653	5.0	 Great to use when you are at the gym or need to have your hands free without a cord in your way	1
6654	5.0	 You can change the settings on the double tap feature for each ear	1
6656	5.0	most of the time I only have one in so I am limited in what I can do without picking up my phone	1
6656	5.0	this is a very minor inconvenience	1
6657	1.0	If you have any problems, Apple will walk you through troubleshooting steps, then send you to Apple	0
6658	1.0	 Apple fixed but then issued reoccurred and now out of Amazon’s return timeframe	0
6659	1.0	 Now having to go back to Apple, but they won’t refund	0
6660	1.0	 Just keep having to get issue repaired again until warranty runs out	0
6661	1.0	 I love AirPods	1
6661	1.0	 there is virtually no way to get a refund for a defective set, it seems	0
6663	1.0	Do not buy these	0
6664	1.0	 I am not sure if it is because new airpods are out or if this is not through apple directly	0
6665	1.0	 My AirPods constantly fail to connect	0
6665	1.0	 at least once a week i will leave both in the charging case only to have one of them be dead when i wake up	0
6666	1.0	 Absolutely horrible product and doesnt work more often than it does	0
6667	1.0	 Please do not waste your money like I did	0
6669	4.0	 I have spent 100's of dollars trying to find a pair of headphones that work for me	1
6670	4.0	 these are still not them	0
6671	4.0	 If you have small ear holes these will fall out constantly	0
6672	4.0	 So, I honestly hate using these so much	0
6673	4.0	 with all that being said, they are VERY comfortable	1
6674	4.0	 they do not hurt my ears at	1
6676	4.0	 The sound is REALLY good	1
6677	4.0	 The convenience is the only reason I didn't return them	1
6678	4.0	 The battery life lasts FOREVER	1
6679	4.0	 I think I have charged them three times since I got them	1
6680	4.0	 They connect really easily too	1
6682	4.0	 The best way to know if they will fit and stay in is to wear the ones the phone came with exactly the same fit without the mess of a cord	1
6684	2.0	Very Disappointed with this Apple product	0
6685	2.0	 Had it for two years and didn’t think of buying the extended warranty as you’d think with the name of “Apple” it meant American even though made in China	0
6687	2.0	 Thanks Apple for taking my money in me buying this one of a kind worthless junk novelist item	0
6691	1.0	I purchased this back in October	1
6692	1.0	 When I received them I notice a like burned spot inside the case	0
6692	1.0	 I have very little time to worry about small marked I decided to overlook	0
6693	1.0	 Every time I used them no one could hear me on the other end	0
6694	1.0	 I was told that was to late and to have apple care deal with the issue, when I called Apple care I discover that not only the serial number was not listed	0
6696	1.0	 Now they don’t even turn on	0
6697	1.0	 I called amazon and the response was too bad go to Apple care	0
6700	1.0	 i this point I am to believe they selling refurbished item for new	1
6701	1.0	 they costumers support is unsupported	0
6702	1.0	 they disconnected the call while I was talking	0
6703	5.0	Had these airpods for 10 months	1
6704	5.0	 Still works great	1
6705	5.0	 Just advise that you have to clean these periodically, as it will tend to get dirty very quickly	1
6706	5.0	These air pods are quite light and very durable which is expected for a product coming from Apple	1
6707	5.0	 Sound quality is nice	1
6707	5.0	 there are other airpods out there that may perform better	0
6708	5.0	its status for longevity is still being observed, as I only had it for 10 months	1
6709	5.0	 I will keep this post updated if anything changes from this product	1
6710	5.0	I started teaching my yoga classes via zoom out of necessity	1
6711	5.0	 I set up my iPad and everything worked great, except the sound	1
6712	5.0	 I had to speak at full volume for anyone to hear me	0
6713	5.0	 It was exhausting	0
6714	5.0	 Then another teacher recommended these	1
6715	5.0	 I was hesitant to spend so much money hoping for a less costly solution	1
6717	5.0	 I can have my head down in a pose demonstrating and talking and can be heard by everyone	1
6718	5.0	 Love them	1
6719	5.0	 And I use them for listening to music or movies too	1
6720	5.0	 Brilliant product	1
6721	5.0	I got these for a good price on Black Friday	1
6721	5.0	I never used earbuds much because they were uncomfortable and/or didn’t fit right	0
6722	5.0	 I’ve been using them every day since they arrived	1
6723	5.0	 The sound quality is good for me and I like the fit	1
6724	5.0	 I’m a little concerned that some people had problems with them not working after a short time so i will update if that happens	0
6725	5.0	 So far so good	1
6728	5.0	If you are not a fan of silicon plugs and have around 100$ to shell out these 2nd gens are nice as crap	1
6729	5.0	 Something about how fast they connect and I guess my ears evolved specifically for these as they are comfortable	1
6730	5.0	 I don’t regret buying them to any degree	1
6731	5.0	I never thought I would own a pair of these since I would prefer wired headphones but since I got a new iPhone and it didn’t come with a headphone jack I went ahead and bought this	1
6732	5.0	 So far I’ve been impressed with these AirPods because I could be listening to music or a podcast and just have the phone sitting on a table	1
6733	5.0	 Battery life is excellent since I don’t use it often	1
6734	5.0	 Overall I’ve been enjoying my AirPods	1
6735	2.0	Overall I'm impressed with the sound quality	1
6736	2.0	 The connectivity works 90% of the time	1
6737	2.0	 Another complains is that there is no external charging light indicator	0
6738	2.0	 You have to open the case to confirm that the device is being charged	0
6739	2.0	 However my biggest complaint is that there is a ridge between the two pieces of molded plastic which has a cutting affect on my ears	0
6740	2.0	 My ears literally bleed after wearing them for a week	0
6741	2.0	 These are my second Generation 2 Apple EarPods, both have the same problems	0
6742	2.0	 For the price, I expect more from Apple	0
6743	2.0	The airbuds worked great for a few weeks	1
6743	2.0	the right earbud stopped working completely	0
6744	2.0	 I tried everything to get it to work	0
6746	2.0	 What kind of warranty is that	0
6747	5.0	These Airpods came in brand new as expected	1
6748	5.0	 I got these for my girlfriend since she got me some so I had to return the favor	1
6749	5.0	 They have an amazing sound quality	1
6749	5.0	 they connect to your phone almost right away	1
6750	5.0	 It’s a little more difficult for people like me who only use one side most of the time since sometimes they won’t catch that it’s in your ear but they’re still great products	1
6751	5.0	The charging speed of Airpods is INSANE	1
6751	5.0	you can fully charge them in like 30 minutes	1
6752	5.0	 they’ll get charged most of the way in like 10 minutes and they still last a long time before having to charge them	1
6753	3.0	Overall AirPods are a good product	1
6753	3.0	they do well for what they are intended	1
6755	3.0	 My bottom-line recommendation, is if you can live with the heavier and larger Amazon Echo Buds, the latter are a FAR better value for the money, and work just as well as AirPods	0
6756	1.0	Once I dropped my AirPod at TSA, I turned around 2 seconds later to find the one AirPod and the feature to find my that was ringing stopped though the AirPod wasn’t dead	0
6757	1.0	 Since then I haven’t been able to connect my other AirPod all though my AirPod is charged and all	0
6758	1.0	 I tried to reset and nothing	0
6759	1.0	 So now I need to buy a whole new set	0
6760	1.0	 I have insurance, so hopefully I can get it resolved	1
6763	5.0	 The knock-off’s earbuds don’t fit the ear the same way and fall out easily	0
6763	5.0	 the connection between the iPhone and the earbuds is spotty	0
6763	5.0	 the battery life is not anywhere near what the AirPods offer, and controlling the knockoff is a nightmare	0
6764	5.0	 If you’re waffling about spending the money and you really want excellent sound quality and the rest of the differences	1
6765	5.0	 Yes they are priced higher than I wish they were	0
6767	5.0	First I was disappointed with the fit in my ear	0
6768	5.0	 My old Apple wired Earbuds sounded better	0
6769	5.0	It can be tricky to position them in your ears	0
6776	5.0	 People should go to the Apple website/Airpod support and read everything about the different versions of Airpods and Cases	1
6777	1.0	I bought this ""NEW"" airpods, and NOT ONLY they where used, but they where BROKEN	0
6778	1.0	As I got them more than 60 days later than when I bought them, amazon did not return me the money and there was nothing that they could do	0
6779	1.0	Luckily the airpods are originals, so apple did change both earbuds	1
6780	1.0	 I lost 5 month of warranty and of course the charging case is used, as the airpods were being used since September 2020 by I dont know who and I got them on February 2021	0
6782	4.0	I have owned these AirPods for a little over a month	1
6783	4.0	 During that time, my AirPods where amazing, great sound quality, great battery life, and it doesn’t fall out the ears	1
6784	4.0	 It’s way better than the standard earphones that you get with a new iPhone	1
6786	4.0	 Unfortunately, the charging case was completely unresponsive, it never turned back on despite leaving it charging for more than a day (yes I used different chargers and yes they all worked on my phone)	0
6787	4.0	 I contacted apple about it and I was offered a $40 replacement for a problem I didn’t ask for	0
6788	4.0	 Apple is so greedy lol	0
6790	5.0	I love them	1
6791	5.0	 I’ve been one of those people who never wanted earbuds but i finally decided to try them as they were on sale	1
6792	5.0	 I’m so glad i did, i love them	1
6793	5.0	 The sound is great, no noise and they last a long time battery-wise	1
6795	2.0	I purchased these AirPods for $99	1
6796	2.0	 After receiving them and charging them overnight I use them for one hour	0
6797	2.0	 the left AirPod lost 50% of its power during that one hour of use	0
6798	2.0	 I contacted Apple to see if I could get a warranty replacement	0
6799	2.0	 After confirming the serial number several times Apple was not able to confirm the legitimacy of the AirPods	0
6800	2.0	 I immediately sent them back to Amazon	0
6801	2.0	They appear to be legitimate	1
6802	2.0	 They look to be brand new the packaging appeared to be new and legitimate	0
6803	2.0	 However I got a little gun shy after Apple could not verify the serial number	0
6804	3.0	I keep losing these because they just wont fit snug	0
6805	3.0	 They're not noise cancelling so i hear a bunch of crap	0
6809	4.0	I LOVE the quality of these ear buds	1
6810	4.0	 The issue I have is that twice in a week the right one has quit working	0
6812	4.0	 I think they arrived on Monday	1
6813	4.0	 I had to delete off my phone and then reinstall them to make it work	1
6814	4.0	 Then yesterday the right one turned off	0
6815	4.0	 I could not get it to come back on	0
6816	4.0	 I put them in case and it showed battery was just 3%	0
6819	4.0	 That is quite disappointing	0
6821	5.0	I gave sound quality a 4 star because overall that is how I view them	1
6822	5.0	 Listening to music, ummm not so optimal but it is bearable but this come from someone that has Bose headphones	1
6823	5.0	 But I didn't purchase these for music obviously, so the features it has and the quality of sound for call taking is great	1
6824	5.0	 It actually what I expected and exceeded expectations which is why i bought the less expensive version only used for taking calls on the go and around the house	1
6830	5.0	out of all the buds I have tried, these are really top notch for music, they don't seal your ear, so theirs no ear pressure, the call quality is outstanding	1
6831	5.0	 I can hear everything quite clearly on the other end when I call my wife	1
6832	5.0	 It was not like that with all the other wireless buds I have tried, including my pair of BeatsX	1
6833	5.0	 It's like it's a wired connection	1
6834	5.0	 The new H1 chip is really great	1
6835	5.0	 That being said, they are not as comfortable as my beatsX, I can wear those all day	1
6836	5.0	 These I couldn't wear for more than 20 mins before they started hurting my ears alot	0
6837	5.0	 If you have small ears, these may do the same for you and you may need the beatsX style earbuds like me	0
6838	5.0	I recently upgraded my AirPods - I have a 2017 pair, and I just upgraded to a 2020 pair	1
6839	5.0	 It's absolutely worth it	1
6840	5.0	The battery life is so much better	1
6841	5.0	 Also, it reads your texts to you and Siri will even let you text back just by talking to her	1
6842	5.0	 These ones are so much better	1
6843	5.0	Highly recommended - worth the money	1
6844	1.0	These are Previously Owned	1
6848	1.0	 In addition, they had scuff marks on the case as well, with a bit of Dr Antonios hand grease or pocket dirt on the case button	0
6849	1.0	 Incredibly, they were sealed like a new pair	0
6850	1.0	 If you don't want a used pair, avoid these	0
6851	1.0	 These work fine, but I did not pay for a used item, or should I say Preowned	0
6852	1.0	Good point is that Amazon took care of me on this purchase	1
6856	1.0	I bought these as a gift	1
6858	1.0	 Upon receiving I noticed the plastic wrap was missing	0
6859	1.0	 I opened the box and all appeared to be ok, the wrap around the case was intact, information was there, charge cord there	1
6860	1.0	When I gave the gift, we opened up to charge and I saw it didn’t look shiny and new- there were scratches	0
6861	1.0	 And then from my pictures you can see they are dirty- with someone’s earwax	0
6863	1.0	I am promptly sending back and will re purchase at a store where I can see they are brand new	0
6865	5.0	I have only had these about a week so we will see how they do over time but my first impressions are very positive	1
6866	5.0	 I have had two sets of cheaper ear phones that have had horrible battery life and pretty short lives overall so I decided to spend the money on Apple air-pods this time	1
6867	5.0	 The battery time is much better and when they do need to be charged the fact that they recharge in their carrying case is a big deal	1
6868	5.0	 I've gone a couple of days without having to plug them back in to a power source	1
6869	5.0	 Sound quality has been good to this point	1
6870	3.0	I had two issues with these ear buds	0
6871	3.0	 First, I do not have an apple phone, and while the ear buds are supposed to work with other devices - and they do - the sound quality is quite poor	0
6872	3.0	 the volume level is just so-so at max volume	0
6873	3.0	 I was disappointed because the item I wanted them to work with was an Apple product	0
6874	3.0	 I took it to the Apple store near me and the tech person who worked with me agreed	0
6875	3.0	 So, if you are buying to work with your Apple phone (which my wife has), they are fine	1
6876	3.0	 Other than that and you will be disappointed	0
6879	2.0	 when i got them they worked flawless, if only they had stayed that way	1
6882	2.0	 i reset them over 100 times pissed off because i had just spent 160 dollars on earbuds that had the durability of paper	0
6883	2.0	 keep in mind i didn’t drop them a single time when this had happened	1
6884	2.0	 i ignored it and just used one earbud	0
6885	2.0	 this became a big problem when i wanted to block out noise when riding the bus	0
6887	2.0	 i had heard rumors about them becoming quiet due to wax build up but i made sure my ears stayed clean 24/7	1
6888	2.0	 but it happened to me anyways	0
6889	2.0	 i searched up how to fix it and i used all the things they told me to do, but nothing worked	0
6890	2.0	 so i did the only thing i knew would actually work, i poked out the mesh inside of the airpod where the music comes out	0
6892	2.0	 anyways if you buy these and they cut in and out go return them because you have a year warranty and i didn’t notice that so don’t mess up like i did and poke out the mesh in the earbud and void your warranty	1
6894	5.0	 Which all have apple phone, I pads and air pods	1
6895	5.0	 I got my daughter air pods for Christmas 2019	1
6896	5.0	 Since the left ear bud stopped working and the case has metal fragments in it	0
6897	5.0	 Cleary a defective case	1
6898	5.0	 I called customer support and was given 2 options	1
6899	5.0	 Take it to a apple store or best buy	1
6900	5.0	 All which are closed in PA due to Covid 19	0
6901	5.0	 Or pay a refundable deposit of 59	1
6907	5.0	 Who also said that is all I can offer you at this point	0
6908	5.0	 This burned my butt, since I have spent a lot of money on Apple products over the years	0
6916	1.0	Ordered back in May 2020 charging case isn’t working as of July 2020 so the return window is closed had to go through apple support and they wanted $70 to replace the charging case on top of the $130+ that I had already spent that would make $200	0
6917	1.0	 All I needed was what I payed for, which is a working AirPod case the Earbuds still work	1
6918	1.0	 So thanks but no thanks	0
6919	1.0	 This is the second pair I’ve gone through from the year prior, I feel absolutely cheated out of my money so yes I am leaving a bad review for the faulty product you sold me	0
6921	5.0	Great airpods	1
6922	5.0	 Low latency, good sound quality	1
6923	5.0	 Please put in the dissription that these are GENERATION 2 Airpods so people won't get confused to whether they are getting gen 1 or gen 2 airpods	0
6924	5.0	 I had to look up my serial number on the apple site to make sure, and these are generation 2 airpods not generation 1	1
6926	5.0	 So this is truly the latest model	1
6928	2.0	These were alright until they stopped working	0
6929	2.0	 Overall, the quick connection and being able to have either the right or left earbud in was great	1
6930	2.0	 They work smoothly with the apple software	1
6931	2.0	 However, I would not recommend these for runners	0
6932	2.0	 I was unable to keep them in my ear when running and was constantly worried about them falling out	0
6933	2.0	 After three months of regular use the right earbud stopped working	0
6934	2.0	 For something this expensive, they should last much longer	0
6935	2.0	 I would recommend getting a cheaper pair from somewhere else	0
6938	1.0	The battery Apple used for this product is probably the worst in line	0
6939	1.0	 After half a year of using the airpods literally only last 2 hrs and I had to alternate	0
6940	1.0	And after using these for about a year, my friends told me my voice over the phone was choppy and was hard to pick up	0
6941	1.0	 I tested a few times and found out it was the mic in the left pod that wasn’t working	0
6942	1.0	 When I brought these to the Genius Bar they wouldn’t even try to figure out the issue and refused to fix it, simply told me to “buy a new pair”	0
6943	1.0	I’ve been using apple products since Apple Shuffle, iPod, and all the way now to MacBooks and airpods, this is the first time that Apple wouldn’t even try to fix their thing	0
6944	1.0	 This really pissed me off, I will never recommend anyone to even think about buying their airpods (or pro) simply coz these are bad quality, and the manufacturer will def drop the ball if anything would happen	0
6945	5.0	These are great headphones, I wear them working out and at work and the sounds is great	1
6946	5.0	 They aren't noise cancelling, but I haven't noticed any issues with it at the gym or at work	1
6947	5.0	 Sometimes they cut in and out so the connection can be weird, but that may just be my phone, and it's only happened 2-3 times	1
6948	5.0	 I recommend airpods to everyone I know	1
6949	5.0	 Very convenient to wear and stay in my ears perfectly	1
6950	1.0	Received the item and the left ear bud didnt work at all	0
6953	1.0	the replacement pair came in and they work just fine	1
6954	1.0	Says new but they are used	0
6957	5.0	 I got these for my 11 year old for Christmas	1
6958	5.0	 He absolutely loves them	1

6960	5.0	 My son plays basketball and can be rough	1
6961	5.0	 They work perfect despite being dropped	1
6962	1.0	I own many apple products, from phones to iPads to watches to AirPods	1
6963	1.0	I bought 2nd generation AirPods for my son, at the time they were the latest model	1
6964	1.0	I have never needed to contact customer service at Apple until now	1
6965	1.0	 It was the worst customer experience ever	0
6966	1.0	 After seven months, the AirPods were no longer functioning normally	0
6967	1.0	 It took 2 1/2 hours on the phone to find out that I needed to spend $150 to get my warranteed product replaced	0
6968	1.0	 They promised to reimburse me	0
6969	1.0	 But this was not an acceptable solution for me	0
6970	1.0	 I had to spend $150 just to mail back the product and get a replacement	0
6971	1.0	 Then I was told I would be reimbursed	0
6972	1.0	 That price is more than the AirPods are worth today	0
6973	1.0	 And I was told I could not speak to anyone higher up	0
6974	1.0	 I am severely disappointed in apple’s customer service	0
6975	1.0	 And I will rethink any further Apple purchases	0
6976	5.0	I ordered my husband a set of AirPods	1
6977	5.0	 When delivered, the postman did not follow instructions on where to place packages which are posted all over my place	1
6978	5.0	 The AirPods were chewed by a dog	1
6979	5.0	 I called amazon and they replaced the set quickly sending me a return label for the damaged one	1
6980	5.0	 I appreciate their fast customer service and that this we resolved so well	1
6981	5.0	 I will continue to order	1
6982	5.0	As far as the actual AirPods, I don’t know why we have lived so long without them	1
6983	5.0	 They’re “smart” switching on when I put them in my ears	1
6984	5.0	 They have a long battery life and great sound	1
6985	5.0	 Love them	1
6986	1.0	This is my second time buying these airpods because i lost one of pods last time	0
6987	1.0	 But i won’t lie there was a probably with my old pair which i got from the same buyer	0
6988	1.0	 Like the fact that the right bud wouldn't charge sometimes or bluetooth just wouldn’t work	0
6989	1.0	 Now i’m having the same issue and its not even two weeks in since i got these	0
6990	1.0	 Do yourself a favor and get them from the apple store instead	1
6991	1.0	 These are fake	0
6992	1.0	Bought a pair off Amazon, and had a lot of connectivity issues	0
6993	1.0	 Took it to genius bar apple and they replaced both headphones and now the right ear is good volume and the left is nearly non-existent	0
6995	1.0	 There is high demand for support of products which delays service you need to fix issues	0
6996	1.0	Update since last review, the right airpod has now gone out	0
6997	1.0	 Not even a year old and totally worthless	0
6998	1.0	 Worst pair of headphones I've ever had	0
6999	5.0	This is the real deal	1

7002	5.0	 I can keep my phone near the window where receiption is good and use the airpods for phone calls	1
7003	5.0	 Love them for a walk	1
7004	5.0	 The value of these are great I already owned airpods but lost the right ear peice	1
7005	5.0	 Apple would replace one piece for $63 plus shipping	1
7006	5.0	 This buy from amazon included both ear peices, charging case, cable for $119	1
7007	1.0	These replacement AirPods stopped working after a few months with my original charging case	0
7008	1.0	 Took them into an Apple store to be looked at and the tech informed me the AirPods were a replica and not actual Apple brand pods	0
7009	1.0	 In fact when the tech ran the serial number it came back that the same serial number was registered to 28 other fake AirPods out there as well	0
7010	5.0	Sound quality is good	1
7011	5.0	 I love how smoothly my AirPods synced up with my iPhone straight out of the box and pair immediately when I put them in my ears	1
7012	5.0	 There is not really any noise cancellation, but these do t really claim to so I don’t hold that against them	1
7013	5.0	 They are surprisingly comfortable to wear	1
7014	5.0	 I use them for work because I am on the phone my entire shift	1
7015	5.0	 The battery life is about 2 hours when talking on the phone before needing charged	1
7017	5.0	 Nice thing is I can take one out and have it charging then switch and charge the other, all without interrupting my calls	1
7018	5.0	 Really, only complaint is battery life, but I get it	1
7019	5.0	 They are small and wireless	1
7021	5.0	 I’m sure that will improve with newer versions	1
7022	5.0	Gave this as a gift and they really enjoyed the how comfortable it fits within their ears	1
7023	5.0	 Tested out noice cancellation and that feature works like a charm	1
7024	5.0	 They could not hear me speak at all while it was on	0
7025	5.0	The quality of the sound from the speakers could be better	1
7026	5.0	 Battery life is okay lasts about 3-4 hours with music and definitely less with calls	1
7027	5.0	 At least you’ll have the charging case to charge it when not in use	1
7028	3.0	It’s been almost a year since I bought these and they have officially stopped working	0
7029	3.0	 They connect to my device, they pair, they hold a charge, but the sound doesn’t transmit	0
7030	3.0	 I’ve tried all the fixes	0
7031	3.0	they’ve worked in the past but not anymore	0
7032	3.0	 Seriously disappointing	0
7034	3.0	 When they worked, they worked pretty well	1
7036	3.0	 I’ve gone back to wired headphones	0
7040	4.0	 I' m hooked	1
7041	4.0	I use them for international and local US conf calls ALL day long and they are great	1
7042	4.0	 While I do forget they are in , after a long time in my ears, my ears get annoyed/sore	0
7043	4.0	 I have small ears	0
7044	4.0	I would like if there was a small version or cushion	0
7045	4.0	I've been through a seriously long list of bluetooth headphones for exercise and business, and these are definitely the best to date	1
7048	1.0	 the case was completely dead and would not charge	0
7049	1.0	 I tried trouble shooting them by holding down the power button to hard reset and nothing worked	0
7050	1.0	 Returned them on February 11th and am still waiting on a replacement	0
7051	1.0	 I keep having to go in and approve delayed shipments, but I’m about ready to just cancel and order the newer version	0
7052	1.0	 This is too much of a hassle for earbuds that don’t even fit in my ear properly	0
7053	5.0	Bought these because wires are so early 21st century, pleased to say it's a fairly uncompromising product	1
7054	5.0	 Easy to use, great audio quality (especially considering their size), and they're surprisingly pleasing from a tactile perspective	1
7056	5.0	It's especially pleasing considering how many products these days disappoint in some way or another, though I think these fit the bill of a ""premium"" product	0
7057	3.0	First of all, the product title says ""Latest Model"" but I received the air pods generation 1, which may or may not explain my disappointing observations	0
7058	3.0	 I had a lot of expectations for these air pods because they were $140	0
7059	3.0	 When I used them for the first time, I was shocked at how cloudy/faded out the audio was	0
7060	3.0	 It also has very little to no noise cancellation	0
7062	3.0	 The battery only lasted me roughly 3 hours and then it had to go back into the charging case	0
7063	3.0	 The only pros was that these air pods looked nice, the fit was comfortable-- I wouldn't recommend it unless you just want it for the hype	0
7064	3.0	 I've bought cheaper wireless earbuds that sounded much clearer and better and lasted me a few days without charging (7-8 hours of use)	0
7066	4.0	If you're looking for something that will be very loud this might not be it	0
7067	4.0	 It has great sound but isn't the loudest product	1
7069	4.0	 I Personally cant go on long runs/ or sprint on a track with them in without adjusting them over and over again	0
7070	4.0	 Yes they have fallen out while doing sprints	0
7071	4.0	They are comfortable and the battery life on the case and each Air Pod is great	1
7072	5.0	It was time for new ear buds	1
7073	5.0	 My 2 year old horse shoe around your neck LG ones only worked if you kept your phone in your shirt pocket	1
7074	5.0	 I didn’t want to spend that much money but so glad I did	1
7076	5.0	 The sound is as good as my home stereo	1
7076	5.0	 they work completely with my 4-5 year old IPhone SE and my 7 year old IPad	1
7079	5.0	 I wish I had tried these first	1
7080	5.0	 The sound quality is amazing	1
7081	5.0	 They are comfortable to wear and the microphones are great	1
7082	5.0	 The only thing they lack is volume control which would be a very nice feature	1
7083	5.0	 These may not be the latest and greatest, but they are good enough for me	1
7084	4.0	I own an android and this is by far the only good product that Apple has	1
7085	4.0	 It works nicely with my phone connects quickly and the sound is great	1
7085	4.0	 I would recommend this to my friends the only flaw that I see in this is that you can't skip songs on Android at least	1
7087	4.0	 Overall great stuff	1
7088	4.0	 For the price it's a bit expensive but if you get it on sale it's well worth it	1
7090	1.0	 I spent a combination of close to 4 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved	0
7091	1.0	 Finally, amazon said I could return them	0
7094	1.0	 They were BROKEN	0
7097	1.0	 You just made her mow four more lawns to rebuy the same headphones	0
7098	1.0	 Pretty rotten	0
7099	1.0	This product broke just out of warranty	0
7100	1.0	 Not just one pod both pods and the charging case have broken with all different issues	0
7102	1.0	 Very disappointed and out a lot of money	0
7105	5.0	 The sound is beyond awesome	1
7106	5.0	 I’ve had several sets of wireless earphones, but nothing like this	1
7107	5.0	 I’ll have to let you know about battery life since I just got them	1
7108	5.0	 They were so easy to pair and then your ready to listen	1
7109	5.0	 Someone told me what a big difference there would be and that’s why I ordered them	1
7110	5.0	 He was so right	1
7111	5.0	 I’m going to enjoy these AirPods	1
7113	5.0	I bought these to listen to music, but now I use them for everything	1
7116	5.0	 Anyhow, it’s a great product I wish I would’ve spent a few more dollars and bought the wireless case	1
7117	5.0	 And they are waterproof, I did wash them in the case at the laundry mat on heavy soil	1
7119	5.0	I love them they sound great work great look great good deal I only needed the 1st gen I understand the 2nd gen is a little more upgraded but who needs it	0
7121	5.0	 I would buy if you want to splurge	0
7122	5.0	I like how easy to use they are, how good is the sound	1
7123	5.0	 I like the little charging box	1
7124	5.0	 I have not found a way to control the volume without invoking Siri	0
7125	5.0	 The battery is reasonably durable but I wish it lasted one full day	1
7127	1.0	Worst bluetooth ever	0
7128	1.0	After a month use, right earpiece is fading out	0
7129	1.0	 When I make a call, the part on the other side barely hears	0
7130	1.0	 Many of this cases were reported to Apple(according to apple support community), but Apple doesn’t even have any solution for a long time	0
7131	1.0	 This happens to Airpod and Airpod Pro	0
7132	1.0	But my left part earpiece keep falling out and I can’t even make a call with this bad designed product	0
7133	1.0	My old $20 Bluetooth or my son’s Galaxy buds works much better than this airpod	0
7134	3.0	First pair stopped working after 2 weeks	0
7135	3.0	 Amazon tech support tried to troubleshoot several times but finally they requested that I exchange	1
7137	3.0	 Will provide update on new pair, hopefully they will last	1
7138	5.0	Gift for my grandson	1
7139	5.0	 He was thrilled to get them	1
7140	5.0	 I also have a pair and that's the reason I bought him a set too	1
7141	5.0	 The quality of the product overall is good	1
7142	5.0	 The sound outside & noise canceling of cars going by is wonderful but you can still tell what's going on around you for safety purposes which was important to me	1
7143	5.0	 They are not waterproof so when walking in the rain I use the hood on my rain jacket to keep them dry	1
7145	1.0	I noticed the headphones did not consistently charge in the case	0
7146	1.0	 It was very finicky and would lead the the airpods being dead half the time I would reach for them	0
7147	1.0	 Ultimately, I took them to the Apple Store, who then sent them off to be fixed/replaced	1
7151	1.0	I purchased these airpods in November	1
7152	1.0	 A few months later, the left airpod stopped working	0
7153	1.0	 I brought this to an Apple Store for repair	1
7154	1.0	The gentleman at the Genius Bar said that based on the serial number, this airpod had already been "replaced" in the past, and could therefore not be fixed	0
7155	1.0	 He was nice enough to send in a request to have this error fixed	1
7155	1.0	 I will need to wait about a week until it can be replaced despite being well into the 1 year warranty	1
7156	1.0	 Massive inconvenience	0
7157	1.0	 I am so disappointed Apple didn't do anything to remedy faster	0
7158	5.0	I got these as a gift, and I was worried about purchasing these online, and when they arrived they were exactly what you’d get in store but cheaper	1
7159	5.0	 They work really well, easy to connect, you adjust the settings for them in the blue tooth menu on your iPhone	1
7160	5.0	 And they stay charged for a long time as well and came with a iPhone charger	1
7161	5.0	 I recommend these if you’re able to not lose them as they can be lost very easily	0
7162	5.0	 They do make cords to attach to them so you can wear them around your neck	1
7163	5.0	 But other then that, I have zero complaints about these AirPods	1
7164	5.0	 I’m very happy I decided to purchase these through amazon	1
7165	1.0	This was a used/refurbished product	0
7166	1.0	 After 2 weeks of using them, people could no longer hear me when on the phone	0
7167	1.0	 The audio quality made me sound like I was underwater	0
7168	1.0	 I purchased these for work and could no longer use them	0
7169	1.0	 I took them to apple and they cleaned them and the problem was still there	0
7170	1.0	 Apple notified me that this was a refurbished product that was returned to amazon before I bought them	1
7171	1.0	 Amazon should really notify a customer that the product is not new so things like this do not happen	0
7172	5.0	I had borrowed a friend's old AirPods gen 1 for about 3 weeks until I had to give them back	1
7173	5.0	 After one week without AirPods filled with relentless struggle using cheaper wireless earbuds, I realized I had to buy my own pair	1
7174	5.0	 That one week was torture	1
7175	5.0	I can't tell you how happy I am to be using these AirPods again	1
7176	5.0	 The design is sleek, slender and pocket-friendly	1
7177	5.0	 The wireless connection is superb between my iPhone and MacBook	1
7178	5.0	Plus- if a friend also has airpods, you can ""bump"" your sound and listen to the same song, podcast or tv show coming from one apple device	1
7180	5.0	 They come with a lightning cable but NOT a charging block	1
7181	5.0	I love these very much	1
7182	5.0	 I owned a pair of Bluetooth earbuds prior to getting AirPods and I didn’t like them very much because they didn’t stay in my ears and the battery didn’t last very long	0
7183	5.0	 The battery life of these AirPods last for a long time in comparison on a single charge	1
7184	5.0	 They stay connected without difficulty to my iPhone and I couldn’t ask for a better pair of earbuds	1
7185	5.0	 I’m glad I got these for myself	1
7186	5.0	 The sound quality is 10/10 and the noise cancellation is amazing, the best I’ve ever had to be honest	1
7187	4.0	The only reason I gave it four stars is because its price is not as good as it is on Black Friday	1
7188	4.0	 I remember only selling 109 at that time	1
7189	4.0	 Of course, the price of amazon is now better than best buy and target	1
7190	4.0	The sound quality is definitely not comparable to beat, but I think it's not bad	1
7191	4.0	 Used to answer the phone, watching TV is already very good	1
7192	5.0	I charged the case and ear buds when they arrived even though they were over 80%	1
7193	5.0	 I used the ear buds for the next six days on my walk	1
7194	5.0	 (1hr & 35min) I put them in the charging case when I returned	1
7195	5.0	 I just checked the ear buds and they are fully charged again	1
7196	5.0	 I'm not sure when I will need to charge the case again	1
7197	5.0	 I love this product	1
7198	5.0	 I had to return a cheaper set of ear buds before I bought the Apple Ear Buds	1
7199	5.0	 You get what you pay for most times	1
7201	5.0	I 10/10 recommend buying AirPods but know that you’ll never be able to ever switch to anything else	1
7202	5.0	 I bought my first pair of AirPods three years ago and have been happy with them ever since	1
7203	5.0	 I have also occasionally bought them as gifts for friends/family	1
7204	5.0	 The battery life is amazing	1
7205	5.0	 I use them a lot for work usually listening to music which last me about 7 hours before the 10% warning sign letting you know to charge them	1
7206	5.0	 The AirPod case will usually last me about two days before I need to charge it again	1
7207	5.0	 Also you can track them if lost (iPhone users) on the find my phone app	1
7208	5.0	 It’ll even allow you to play a sound so it’ll be easier to find	1
7210	5.0	 Also I recommend you buy a case for it so it could stay protected and it’s easy access for me since I always attach them on my belt loop	1
7211	5.0	 I truly have never been so sure about recommending something other than AirPods	1
7212	5.0	my AirPods were delivered today, I ordered them on Black Friday	1
7213	5.0	 I read all the reviews to make sure that I wouldn’t be scammed, and although the product had several bad reviews	1
7213	5.0	 I ordered them anyways since I really wanted AirPods and they were sold out everywhere else	1
7214	5.0	 The AirPods came in their original packaging, with everything new and intact	1
7215	5.0	 They weren’t used, dirty, or damaged	1
7216	5.0	 Also, a lot of people are saying that amazon is selling first gen AirPods and saying that they’re second gen, but these are second generation AirPods	1
7217	5.0	 I checked the serial numbers and I’ll attach a picture too	1
7218	5.0	 The reason why there’s no light on the front is because the charging case isn’t a wireless charging case, and it doesn’t say that it comes with one anyways	1
7219	5.0	 The sound quality is fantastic	1
7220	5.0	 I really love these, they are real Apple AirPods and I suggest buying	1
7221	5.0	 If I have any issues, I’ll update, but so far so good	1
7222	5.0	So I'm not an Apple user at all but these were highly recommended for me to use with my Galaxy Note S10+	1
7223	5.0	 The sound is absolutely amazing	1
7224	5.0	 I could hear artists talking during songs that I've never once heard using my phone with or without headphones, Bluetooth in the car or TV sound bar	1
7225	5.0	 I'm very impressed	1
7226	5.0	 A pretty long range for the Bluetooth too	1
7227	5.0	 Moved further away from my phone in the house than previously could with phone from soundbar with no sound interruptions	1
7228	3.0	Sound great	1
7230	3.0	 Difficult to fit in and keep in ears	0
7231	5.0	For some time, I thought that AirPods were a silly luxury	0
7233	5.0	 Set up was a breeze, sound quality is excellent	1
7234	5.0	 Texting - my least favorite things to do - is so easy with Siri	1
7235	5.0	 Auto correct for manual texting is a pain, but Siri dictation works beautifully	1
7238	5.0	 With air pods I can free up my hands , walk both my dogs while answering phone calls and texts, ask Siri to find a news channel, etc, etc	1
7239	5.0	I am very happy with this purchase	1
7240	1.0	Bought the first generation and two months in the left earpiece would go dead twice as fast as the right, by one year the left earpiece no longer worked at all, the set i bought my daughter also was dead by one year	0
7241	1.0	 Bought the gen 2 set to replace them hoping things were better and the right earpiece doesn’t fit the case properly, if i don’t hold it down into the case it won't charge	0
7242	1.0	 Called apple and they were as unhelpful as they were in the past, send us the product you just bought and after a while we’ll send it back and say its within specifications	0
7245	5.0	Honestly the bad reviews are either people who bought from a 3rd party or are too broke that they are switching their used pods for new ones	1
7246	5.0	 These are great	1
7247	5.0	 Honestly I went for the 2nd gen because I had them before (but I forgot one in my pocket and that went in the wash) but liked how they sound	1
7249	5.0	 I also like how they feel in my ear compared to any headphones with the ear rubber pieces, those fall out so easily	1
7250	5.0	 I was too scared to get the 3rd gen because they look different ear wise and then wouldn't know if I could return it cause it wouldve been opened plus I prefer not to spend more than what I spent on these lol	1
7252	5.0	 They were my husbands and he didn’t like them, so I used them and like them	1
7253	5.0	 He got airpods and said huge difference	0
7254	5.0	 I kept them off brand ones all summer and just last week got the second generation air pods and omg husband isn’t wrong huge difference in the sound quality	1
7256	5.0	 Love love them	1
7257	4.0	My son thought this would be a great deal for me since I use corded headphones frequently, and Amazon had them on a daily special	1
7258	4.0	 My problem is that they fall out of my ears and I’m afraid I’ll lose one, so I no longer wear them outside or away from homy	0
7259	4.0	 Batteries give a warning when they’re about to die	0
7260	4.0	 I let both run down before recharging so the charge in each will be even	1
7261	4.0	 Otherwise, one might be at 20% and the other completely dead	1
7262	3.0	I really do like my AirPods	1
7263	3.0	 That being said for the price of these things you would really expect better sound quality as well as noise cancellation	1
7264	3.0	 The battery life is excellent but overall I have to say I would like a higher quality sound with ear plugs	1
7265	3.0	 I use these while riding my motorcycle and have to put them upside down and in opposite years in order to not lose them while I’m riding down the road Not the best use for motorcycle cruising, but work okay otherwise, just not great sound	1
7267	1.0	I purchased these "New" Airpods and when I connected them they were already registered as Akki's Airpods	0
7268	1.0	 Addititonally, the left Airpod does not work	0
7269	1.0	 Complete scam	0
7270	1.0	 I will be returning them promptly	0
7272	5.0	All other earbuds do not even come close to meeting their promised spec	0
7273	5.0	Looks pricey but I feel the one time ~100$ investment on this ear bud is better experience compared to the cheaper <50$ versions which you will end up replacing after warranty expires	1
7274	5.0	 Typically the cheaper products are designed to work till their warranty period with the occasional good one	1
7275	5.0	 I recommend this unless you are feeling lucky	1
7276	4.0	I have an Android, but Airpods are better than other truely-wireless earbuds, plus airpods are the only earbuds with cases you can add that are cool and cute	1
7277	4.0	 I absolutely love them and have had no issues other than the fact that they loose connection for a split second, but I figured its because I dont actually have them connected to another Apple product	1
7278	4.0	 And as for background noise, I can still hear everything happening around me unless I obviously have the volume all the way up	1
7279	5.0	I was reluctant to move from corded earbuds to these but must admit they are great	1
7280	5.0	 Worried they'd fall out of my ears-they don't	1
7281	5.0	 worried they would drain my battery fast and die quickly-so far they haven't	1
7282	5.0	 I know I am a late bloomer on these-but glad to finally join the rest of you and be cord free	1
7283	5.0	After owning a pair of AirPods myself for a long while I bought two pairs for my teens	1
7284	5.0	 They BOTH love them	1
7285	5.0	 Super easy to use and the great quality that you would expect from Apple	1
7286	5.0	 My kids are so happy they no longer have to worry about the cords	1
7287	5.0	 Sound quality is fabulous and they stay in their ears when they workout	1
7288	5.0	 I thought about buying the cheaper brand until I heard of how they stop working so I'm glad that I went ahead and bought quality	1
7290	5.0	 I bought silicon covers for the cases with clips as well	1
7291	5.0	 Super fast delivery	1
7292	5.0	These are 100% legit Gen 2 AirPods	1
7293	5.0	 For all the people saying the charging indicator light should be on the outside of the case for Gen 2 cases	1
7293	5.0	 I bought a pair of G2 AirPods from Verizon and they’re IDENTICAL	1
7294	5.0	 From everything I’ve seen, the Gen 2 cases with the charging indicator light on the outside are the WIRELESS charging cases	1
7295	5.0	 I looked up the model numbers (A2032 A2031 each AirPod) (A1602 charging case) all say Gen 2	1
7296	5.0	Easy to use, most of the time	1
7297	5.0	 Works with ALL my devices	1
7298	5.0	 Easier to use with Apple products	1
7299	5.0	 Battery life is no problem	1
7300	5.0	 Sound is good	1
7301	5.0	 Fit is good	1
7302	5.0	 No opinion on noise cancellation - headphones are better	1
7303	5.0	 It was more than I wanted to pay for wireless earpods/buds, whatever, but you get what you pay for	1
7304	5.0	 If they last, it will be worth the money	1
7305	5.0	 Easy to lose	0
7306	5.0	Two months later: lost an ear pod while walking on a grass field	0
7307	5.0	 Fortunately some kind soul found it in the park where I was walking and placed it on a park bench	1
7308	5.0	 Like looking for a needle in a haystack	0
7309	5.0	 It still works but as I said, they’re easy to lose	0
7310	5.0	So I originally bought some generic pods	1
7312	5.0	 So I returned them and sprung for the real airpods	1
7313	5.0	 I have not regretted it	1
7314	5.0	 The battery life is amazing	1
7315	5.0	 My right ear tends to hurt slightly having the pod in but not such an issue with a plastic cover on it	0
7316	5.0	 The connectivity and setup is AMAZINGLY easy	1
7317	5.0	 I have two Iphones and the airpods connect effortlessly	1
7318	5.0	 I recommend these airpods	1
7320	3.0	These air pods are maybe great for young people	1
7321	3.0	 The battery only seem to last 2 or 3 hours, which is unreal to me	0
7322	3.0	 Kept falling out of my ear, lucky I haven’t lost one	0
7323	3.0	 Don’t notify you have a call, so you have to keep the phone out to answer it	0
7325	3.0	 I would return them if I could	0
7327	3.0	 I miss my old ones so bad	0
7328	3.0	 I recently changed over to all Apple products in December 2019	0
7329	3.0	 I love my phone though	1
7332	3.0	 No luck	0
7333	5.0	I love my AirPods	1
7334	5.0	 This older model requires a lightning wire connection to recharge, but works great	1
7336	5.0	 I use one bud at a time and alternate ears, recharging the unused, one so they can be used all day, then recharge the case overnight	1
7337	5.0	 The case can recharge the buds in 15 minutes several times before needing to be recharged itself	1
7340	5.0	 The charge last for at least two days it seems	1
7341	5.0	 I had a 5 1/2 hour flight and had music playing the entire flight and they never died unlike my previous Beats Wireless headphones that died after 3 hours	1
7342	5.0	 The sound quality is perfect and when I’m on conference calls everyone on the call can hear me perfectly without any background noise or static	1
7344	1.0	Appears to be a genuine product	1
7345	1.0	 However; when installed already had someone else's name pop up when I synced the EarPods to my phone	0
7346	1.0	 I expected to purchase a NEW product	0
7347	1.0	 Nothing in the ad suggests otherwise	0
7348	1.0	 This is not cool	0
7349	5.0	I finally broke down and bought myself some	1
7350	5.0	 I love the way they fit securely in my ears	1
7351	5.0	 I’m another person who has small ears, and some buds just won’t fit/stay in	1
7352	5.0	 Or maybe WE have perfect ears and the buds are made wrong	0
7353	5.0	 They hold a charge for many many hours of use	1
7354	5.0	 My only issue is getting them out of the cute little case	1
7355	5.0	I seem to drop one every time, but that’s no biggie	1
7356	5.0	 I wish there were a little ring on the case, like some of the storage cases	1
7357	5.0	 I highly recommend	1
7358	5.0	I have small ear canals and worried about comfort but these are the best I've ever used	1
7359	5.0	 I love the sound and usually if I'm going to be outside and need to hear other things happening, I just use one at a time and it works great	1
7360	5.0	 The connection between them and my phone is great, and I can be long distances from my phone or leave the phone in the house and they still work	1
7361	2.0	I feel like we have to replace and buy a new set every 2-4 months	0
7362	2.0	 I rely heavily on using the AirPods having to be on the phone a lot	1
7363	2.0	 Suddenly people on the other end of the line are not hearing me well or claim that I have a bad connection, even though reception is clear	0
7364	2.0	 When switching to phone, everything is fine	1
7365	2.0	 I have done numerous tries to troubleshoot with no luck	0
7366	5.0	I ordered these based on the reviews	1
7367	5.0	 The sound quality is amazing	1
7368	5.0	 I already have an Apple phone, so perfect fit	1
7369	5.0	 This model is really comfortable for my ears	1
7370	5.0	 I know a lot of people prefer the smaller ear buds, but I don’t have a problem with this design	1
7371	5.0	 Phone calls come through perfect too	1
7372	5.0	 I would definitely recommend	1
7373	5.0	 Easy to charge, absolutely love these	1
7374	5.0	These little Airpods are great	1
7375	5.0	 I had done extensive research before getting these and had seen a lot of hate online towards these earbuds by many tech reviewers	1
7376	5.0	 I’m not a audiophile, but I think these have awesome sound quality	1
7377	5.0	 Plus, they work great with an iPhone with the instant pairing	1
7378	5.0	 Are they expensive	0
7380	5.0	 Don’t fit in everyone’s ears	0
7382	5.0	 But they are worth it in my opinion	1
7383	5.0	 Better yet, get them on sale during Black Friday/Cyber Monday	1
7384	5.0	 They were $99	1
7385	5.0	99 for the 2020 holiday season	1
7386	1.0	These are are wonderful sounding but sadly the right air pod quit working after 2 months	0
7387	1.0	 I have talked to Amazon customer service three times and they have been wonderful	0
7388	1.0	 We have done all the "trouble shooting" tips and have been able to get them working	1
7389	1.0	 But the next day the right side is again not working	0
7390	1.0	 This is my second set of air pods	0
7391	1.0	 I had the first generation but the microphone went out after 6 months so no one could hear me when I would talk a call	0
7392	1.0	 I waited for the 2 nd generation and finally got a pair delivered on July 7	1
7393	1.0	 It’s September 10 and after three tries with Amazon customer service I will be calling Apple	1
7394	1.0	 I’m not hopeful and don’t recommend	0
7395	1.0	 I only use these when walking outside so it’s not like they are getting a lot of rough, sweaty use	1
7396	4.0	This is definitely brand new AirPods	1
7399	4.0	 I really like this product	1
7400	4.0	 However, it is way easy to lose it	0
7401	4.0	 I’m very frustrated since I purchased this last month, Except high risk of losing it	0
7402	4.0	The price just dropped $30	1
7404	4.0	 I’m a broke student who saved up money for this product	1
7405	4.0	 I can’t believe that I overpaid it again	0 
7408	4.0	 Can I still trust Amazon	0
7409	4.0	 Dumbest purchase ever	0
7410	5.0	By now I'm sure everyone knows these Apple airpods	1
7411	5.0	 The only thing I wish they'd do is curb out background noise for construction people	1
7413	5.0	 If he's on his and I'm on mine and he cuts a key, I sometimes jump a little at the pain coming into my eardrums	0
7414	5.0	 Other than that, for people who don't make loud noise all day, they're obviously very convenient and comfortable	1
7416	4.0	Great sound and mic quality	1
7418	4.0	Put it on and start listening; very easy to use	1
7420	4.0	When you need to share it with someone the whole second point above is gone	0
7421	4.0	 You need to go to bluetooth menu etc like any other headphone	0
7422	4.0	For non-iPhone, the whole ease-of-use is probably not there	0
7423	4.0	The touch actions on the earpieces are not very flexible	0
7424	4.0	 There are some good actions like Previous track, next track, Siri, etc	1
7425	4.0	 I wanted things like Pause call, Unmute mic	1
7426	4.0	 the things that might come in handy at a conference call	1
7427	4.0	 That is not there for AirPods	0
7429	2.0	When this product arrived there was a buzzing sound in the right earpod	0
7430	2.0	 Upon contacting Amazon about the issue they put us in contact with Apple and we have had to ship the product back to Apple for evaluation	0
7431	2.0	 We ordered the refurbished product with the belief that it would be functional	1
7432	2.0	 It was not	0
7433	2.0	Overall the customer service was great from Amazon, but I am now leery of purchasing refurbished again	0
7434	5.0	I recently got an iPhone 12 mini and caved in and bought these	1
7435	5.0	 Yes they're pricey but worth it IMO	1
7436	5.0	Very easy to use and so convenient	1
7437	5.0	 The sound is better than I expected	1
7438	5.0	 I like that you can feel the bass well	1
7439	5.0	 Sometimes they do slip out but you have to try out which way works best for you/your ears	0
7440	1.0	I can honestly say this was a bad investment	0
7441	1.0	 I wanted them so that I can talk on the phone with them in but they continue to disappoint	0
7442	1.0	 The battery life is horrible	0
7443	1.0	 The left never has as much charge as the right	0
7444	1.0	 The sound quality is so so	0
7445	1.0	 Not the best I heard from my other wireless headphones	0
7446	1.0	 I’m really disappointed at the price because I feel like these are cheap products that Apple made and tried to pass off as worth your money when they aren’t	0
7447	1.0	 They’re worst quality than wireless headphones that cost half the amount they do	0
7448	1.0	 Overall, don’t buy these	0
7449	5.0	The main appeal for me was that the Apple earphone design was actually better fitting for my smaller ears	1
7450	5.0	 Silicone tips genuinely bothered me enough that I switched and I'm glad for it	1
7451	5.0	 These do work for general sound quality	1
7452	5.0	 Honestly the extra mobility I get while I work is what makes these amazing, and the easy connectivity to my phone and laptop	1
7453	5.0	This is my first set of AirPods	1
7454	5.0	 I got them so I would be able to listen to music and podcasts while doing other tasks and charging my phone	1
7455	5.0	 So far, so good	1
7456	5.0	 The sound quality sounds great	1
7457	5.0	 Next time I’ll get the wireless because constantly having to charge another device is a bit much	1
7458	5.0	 Also I notice that it’s easy to lose AirPods around the house and the Find Me app on iPhone has not been helpful in finding them	1
7459	5.0	 Otherwise I think this is a good buy	1
7460	5.0	I’ve had these things for about a year now and they have been used almost everyday	1
7461	5.0	 I was really skeptical when I first got these	0
7461	5.0	 I thought they were fake, they weren’t, and a lot of people say that they’re fake which threw me off but they’re real	1
7462	5.0	 The battery life is good although the left one dies faster then the right, but what can you say when you use these all day everyday	1
7463	5.0	 As far as the sound goes, it’s good, not 500 dollar stereo overear headphones but it’s good	1
7464	5.0	Like any other Apple product, these AirPods are amazing	1
7465	5.0	 Easy to connect to your iPhone, super intuitive to use, great range (distance from your phone), small in size	1
7466	5.0	 The fact that you can recharge them directly from the case is another great plus	1
7467	5.0	 When you're not using them, just place them back in the case and they recharge on their own	1
7468	5.0	 I was so happy with this purchase, that I bought another set for my husband and one for my daughter	1
7469	5.0	 Highly recommends	1
7470	5.0	I had purchased a cheaper pair that I found online	1
7471	5.0	 They turned off unexpectedly, the battery ran down quickly you never know when they were going to work	0
7472	5.0	 So I got tired of the problems and ordered these Apple AirPods with Charging Case	0
7473	5.0	 I just love them	1
7474	5.0	 I have had no problems of any kind	1
7475	5.0	 They have work beautifully from day one	1
7476	5.0	 I wish I had not wasted my $50 on those other ones and just bought these the first time	1
7477	5.0	 They have great battery life	1
7479	1.0	 After 5 weeks of used they stopped working	0
7480	1.0	 I called for support and was not provided any assistance from Amazon services who sold them	0
7481	1.0	 What a waste of 150 for 5 weeks	0
7483	5.0	I had doubt on the $150 price for this Apple AirPods when it came out because it's so hard to justify the cost	0
7484	5.0	 I've had several wireless headphones before the AirPods, notably Motorola M9 and M10, and some other generic brands	1
7485	5.0	 None of them is truly wireless when compared to the AirPods	1
7486	5.0	 Most importantly, the AirPods feels comfortable when I wear it for a long time	1
7487	5.0	 This is is one major reason I bought this because the AirPods Pro, though incredible for it's noise canceling, is not suitable for long-time wearing	1
7488	5.0	 The battery of my older first generation AirPods is not good anymore, so I got this newer generation for $99 when it's on sale	1
7489	5.0	 I think it's a great deal and a must buy	1
7490	5.0	I was super against hopping on the AirPod bandwagon for a while I will admit	1
7492	5.0	 And I am so so so glad I bought them and so sad I waited so long to buy them	1
7493	5.0	 Great audio and noise cancelling	1
7494	5.0	 They stay in amazingly	1
7495	5.0	 I’ve worked out and had a bedroom dance party to test them and they stay in and sound is great the whole time	1
7499	1.0	 These came clearly used	0
7500	1.0	 Somebody else’s name already assigned to them, ear wax in both headphones (yuck), and a case that rattles	0
7501	1.0	Pretty lame to sell used stuff as new	0
7502	5.0	I never thought I’d own a pair of these, but after my corded Apple earphones got ripped out while working out 4-5 times, I said enough is enough and bought these	1
7503	5.0	 I’m so glad I did	1
7504	5.0	 The sound quality it great, they don’t hurt my ears, and they never fall out	1
7505	5.0	 Not to mention the Siri function is extremely useful when working out	1
7506	5.0	 I still think they’re a tad bit expensive for what they are	1
7507	5.0	I live for these AirPods	1
7514	5.0	 AirPods are life changing, like honestly	1
7515	5.0	 So yeah, get some	1
7516	1.0	SCAM	0
7517	1.0	 These were not new	0
7519	1.0	 They were originally bought 1,457 days ago	0
7520	1.0	 Found this out when I had to call Apple support because when I received them the left side never worked	0
7521	1.0	 They said to fix them would be $145 because they were out of warranty	0
7524	1.0	 So much for that Christmas present for my son	1
7525	5.0	Very happy with these headphones	1
7526	5.0	 For years I have been buying either knock off blue tooth headphones that either do not fit in my ears (they are small), stay in place during activity (such as running) and or are not compatable with my iphone	0
7527	5.0	 It is quite expensive, however worth it for wireless headphones that actually work for all of the above issues I had with previous headphones	1
7528	5.0	 The only downside is that occasionally the headphones are slow or delayed to react to a song change (with the double tap) or will fall out easily if I hit them accidentally	0
7529	5.0	 Otherwise they do stay in place well, I am just an accident prone person	0
7530	5.0	 The case is also nice so I do not loose them	1
7531	5.0	 I definitely recommend spending the extra $$ for these if you have an iphone	1
7532	5.0	these are my first Bluetooth earbuds	1
7533	5.0	 Honestly, no regrets	1
7534	5.0	 I'm so happy that I can just walk around my small apartment with my podcasts or music playing	1
7535	5.0	 It's also super nice without any wires anywhere when I need to use them in public	1
7536	5.0	 The audio is really great for me, almost too good	1
7537	5.0	 The first few days I had it, I would listen to lectures and I could pick up sounds that made me think someone was near me and it would freak me out lol	1
7538	5.0	I love these AirPods	1
7539	5.0	 I ended up getting a pair of Pros after because they didn’t fit my ears, but I was still very impressed with these	1
7540	5.0	Call quality is crystal clear	1
7541	5.0	 Range is excellent- I could hear my calls from the basement all the way to the 2nd floor	1
7542	5.0	 They snap in the case perfectly, and the case is tiny and fits easily in my pocket	1
7543	5.0	 Sound quality is good	1
7544	5.0	Bad fit - not good for small ear canals like mine	0
7545	5.0	 Ambient sounds can be a bit loud (didn’t expect noise cancellation, though)	0
7546	5.0	 Stems are long and awkward looking, and therefore easier to knock out	0
7547	3.0	Great except the Left one falls out	0
7549	3.0	 Fell out multiple times as I ate dinner	0
7550	3.0	 I really wanted to like these	1
7550	3.0	 if I’m always afraid one will just fall out then what good are they	0
7551	5.0	LOVE THEM	1
7552	5.0	Everything about them pair so well with my iPhone	1
7553	5.0	 Sound quality is through the roof and the noise cancellation is one thing that will come in handy on the busy roads	1
7554	5.0	 The battery life lasts so long too	1
7555	5.0	 They came very secure so they weren’t damaged and everything was in place	1
7556	5.0	 Love it	1
7557	5.0	I bought these for xmas but decided to let him try them to make sure they were okay	1
7561	3.0	After using the airpods for a week or so, I am not thrilled and for this price, I expect better	0
7562	3.0	 Although the design is beautiful, it is hard to get them in your ears, even harder is keeping them in your ears	0
7563	3.0	 I bought them to use on the treadmill and listen to my ipad while cooking	1
7564	3.0	 Exercising with them is frustrating, with the sweaty moisture that goes with exercise, the airpods fall out of your ears and I am going back to the traditional ear buds	0
7565	5.0	I have been wanting a pair of AirPods for a minute but I just didn’t have the funds to get them, so I saved up some money and FINALLY got them	1
7566	5.0	 But of course, I wanted to check if there was a cheaper and easier way to buy them as the closest Apple store is an hour away from me and lo and behold I saw these beauties for $30 cheaper than they are on the Apple store	1
7567	5.0	 I waited a dreadfully long 3 days for them to come and oh my god, I was on top of the moon when I saw they were delivered	1
7568	5.0	 Now before I ordered them I was very skeptical as some people were saying they were fakes and they broke on them as soon as they opened their Airpods	0
7569	5.0	 I don’t know what their reviews were, but mines are brand new	1
7570	5.0	 Sealed and brand new package with brand new Airpods	1
7571	5.0	 Connecting them was a breeze and the sound quality is much better compared to the regular ear pods Apple has that comes with the phones	1
7572	5.0	 I’m in love and I am here to assure you, even though my review will probably get lost in the mix, that these are the real things and I am very satisfied with my purchase	1
7573	1.0	Ok, this is my second review after Amazon deleted my first one	1
7574	1.0	 In their email they claimed it was authentic and it was not fake	1
7575	1.0	 If it was authentic why Apple website didn’t recognize it when I entered the S/N to verify its authenticity	1
7576	5.0	The sound quality is good	1
7577	5.0	 But the battery life and the charging capability is absolutely amazing	1
7578	5.0	 They are just perfect	1
7579	5.0	 No wires bothering you, they stay in good	1
7580	5.0	 Someone ask you a question you take one out it pauses the music	1
7581	5.0	 Take them out put them in the case and in 15 minutes you have fresh head phones	1
7582	5.0	 I haven’t charged the case in over a week and I’m still going strong	1
7583	5.0	 The way they are engineered is truly amazing	1
7584	5.0	Great sound in a tiny comfortable size	1
7585	5.0	 To get any better sound quality you would have to go to full size Bose or Beats	1
7586	5.0	 I am a musician and truly appreciate the sound quality given the convenience of size and price point	1
7587	5.0	 The noise cancellation is not the quality of large headphones but in every other sense, these are great	1
7588	5.0	 Also great ease of Bluetooth connection; just put them in your ears and they connect, no buttons needed	1
7589	5.0	 Great mic for phone calls and the battery life is amazing	1
7590	5.0	 I use them for hours, just plug case in at night and pods stay charged at all times	1
7591	3.0	Sound is excellent for listening to music, watching shows online, and talking on the phone	1
7592	3.0	 I think the mic is very good, too	1
7593	3.0	 But I had these on for an hour and had to remove them twice because they hurt my ears	0
7595	3.0	 But they’re almost double the price	0
7597	4.0	I bought these because I had trouble keeping similar wireless headphones in my ears while walking or exercising	1
7598	4.0	 Other wired or wireless headsets with interchangeable, difference sized soft ear pieces never fit right and had a tendency to come loose or slip out entirely	1
7599	4.0	 Very annoying at the gym in the middle of a class or on the treadmill	0
7600	4.0	 These are so light and hang on the ear that you don't notice they are there	1
7601	4.0	Frankly I don't use them on an iphone device but on an Android phone	1
7602	4.0	 That shouldn't matter	1
7603	4.0	 The only negative is that every once in a while they seem to go out of sync	1
7604	4.0	 This causes an echo effect	0
7605	4.0	 It becomes difficult to understand spoken word because of the echo	0
7606	4.0	 The only way I have found to fix it is to go to Bluetooth settings, disconnect, then reconnect the AirPoids	0
7607	4.0	 That means I have to stop my exercise program to restart them	0
7608	4.0	 Very annoying	0
7609	4.0	 The connected device used shouldn't matter if the Bluetooth is compatible	1
7610	5.0	I initially bought Samsung earbuds because they were highest rated	0
7611	5.0	 I found them to be uncomfortable and more expensive, so I returned them and purchased the earbuds	1
7612	5.0	 They work well, except sometimes people say they cannot hear me	1
7613	5.0	 I like the fit, and the convenience of not having any wires	1
7614	5.0	 They’re the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever had	1
7615	5.0	These AirPods arrived in perfect condition	1
7616	5.0	 New, sealed box with instructions, charging cable, charging case, and of course, the AirPods	1
7617	5.0	 I don’t know why the other reviews are a mixed bag of poor to terrible so far as the product is concerned	1
7618	5.0	 You can tell from my pictures that there is absolutely nothing wrong with them	1
7619	5.0	 I don’t think these are intended for noise canceling, so I rated them a 3 in that area	1
7620	5.0	 Otherwise, 5 stars	1
7621	5.0	 The AirPods and charging case arrived more than 75% charged, too	1
7622	5.0	 Ready to go right out of the box	1
7623	5.0	 Love them	1
7624	1.0	These airpods are 1st generation	0
7625	1.0	 It’s obvious as soon as you open the box	0
7626	1.0	 The light that indicates if it’s charging is on the inside of the case rather than on the outside of the case	0
7627	1.0	 I’m very disappointed but I’ve already opened it so I don’t think I can return them	0
7628	1.0	 If you’re looking for Apple products just go directly to the Apple site	1
7629	5.0	AirPods came as expected, nothing unusual	1
7630	5.0	 If you’re trying to decide if you need to get the wireless case, I would say just go for the wired case	1
7631	5.0	 It charges so fast it isn’t even a problem	1
7632	5.0	 When your AirPods die, the case has charge in it as well, so in a way, it is like having wireless charging	1
7633	5.0	 As long as the case is charged, you can put your AirPods in without having to plug into the wall and it charges	1
7634	5.0	These AirPods don’t fit in my ears like the apple ear pods	0
7635	5.0	 They’re a little looser and don’t go as far into my ears, I’ve noticed	0
7636	5.0	 I’ve gotten use to it and I just turn the volume up a little	1
7637	5.0	The best thing about these headphones isn’t the sound quality	1
7638	5.0	 For me it’s just the user experience	1
7639	5.0	 It automatically connects to the apple device I’m using and the battery percentage shows	1
7640	5.0	 Pop an AirPod out and whatever you’re watching or listening to pauses	1
7641	5.0	 Can tap on the AirPod to answer a call	1
7642	5.0	 I bought them for convenience	1
7643	5.0	Got these as a Christmas gift for my wife	1
7644	5.0	 She has recently started using an exercise bike and with the new Apple Health + option, I got these so that she could listen to the workouts while riding in comfort	1
7645	5.0	 The noise cancellation on these is really good as well, doesn't block out all noise, but you can melt away while using them	1
7646	5.0	 She has used them almost daily since she got them for Christmas and is in love with them	1
7647	5.0	Just received my new pair	1
7648	5.0	 I had a pair of AirPods but unfortunately left them in my pants pocket and they went through a wash cycle	1
7650	5.0	 So I went on amazon to see about buying a new pair	1
7651	5.0	 My old pair was free but this pair was $136 with tax	1
7652	5.0	 I was definitely hesitant to buy these from amazon because of some of the reviews but I’m here to say these are AWESOME	1
7653	5.0	 They are legit Apple AirPods and they’re cheaper on amazon	1
7654	5.0	 The one on the left is my old pair and the new ones are on the right	1
7655	5.0	 There is no difference	1
7656	5.0	 Take it from me, you won’t regret it	1
7657	5.0	 Just make sure to check your pockets ALWAYS	1
7658	5.0	 They are not water proof and the advice Apple gave me did not work for the old ones (leave it out for 24 hours)	1
7659	5.0	 Good investment if you listen to music a lot, make calls, like the convenience of no cords	1
7660	5.0	 Just be careful because it’s a lot of money to lose if you have no AppleCare	1
7661	5.0	 Even with AppleCare there are still fees to replace them	1
7662	5.0	I’d gone through many different types and models of ear buds, and was never happy with any of them	0
7663	5.0	 My wife got these for Christmas and they’re astounding	1
7664	5.0	 I’ll never go back to the ones with wires attaching the two ear buds	1
7666	5.0	 Crystal clear audio	1
7667	5.0	 The music is like listening to a high end sound system with each instrument audible at any volume and the battery set up with charging in the case while you’re not near a plug to charge is an added feature that cannot be overstated as being very, very cool	1
7668	5.0	 Highly recommend these earbuds	1
7669	3.0	if you will only use these with Apple devices, you will probably be completely thrilled	1
7670	3.0	 But if you are connecting to, say, a Sony TV, there are challenges	0
7671	3.0	 You can't adjust the volume of the earphones	0
7672	3.0	And if you switch between devices, you have to "connect" again on the device	0
7673	3.0	 Again, I think if you were all Apple ios, these issues would arise and you would be 100% happy	1
7674	5.0	My son loves these because he can charge his phone and listen to music at the same time	1
7675	5.0	 His friends gently teased him about having wired headphones	0
7676	5.0	 His is happy about the way they fit and the sound is great	1
7677	5.0	 This was a good purchase because I was able to save a few dollars	1
7678	5.0	 It was a good Christmas gift	1
7679	5.0	 You have to keep up with technology and of course that comes at a cost	1
7680	5.0	 It was a good purchase	1
7681	5.0	I hesitated to buy AirPods for a long time because I thought they were quite pricey but when the good deal came available I decided to finally get them	1
7682	5.0	 I’m very glad I did as the sound quality is great and they’re so comfortable to wear	1
7683	5.0	 I really like how easily they pair with all my Apple devices	1
7684	5.0	 All in all, I’m very happy with my purchase	1
7686	5.0	Now, normally I dont use Apple products besides my iPad pro (2018) and Apple pencil 2nd Gen for drawing	1
7687	5.0	But I was seeking some sleek, good sounding earbuds that would go well with my iPad	1
7688	5.0	 Back when I got my iPad, Airpods were way too much for me	1
7689	5.0	 But throughout the years, they have fallen in price	1
7690	5.0	 So I decided to buy them here	1
7691	5.0	 They were only $115	1
7692	5.0	 That, I thought was a steal	1
7693	5.0	 I ordered em up, quick	1
7694	5.0	 Came just in time	1
7695	5.0	 Very quick delivery as well	1
7698	5.0	 I love customization, custom ROMs, and such	1
7699	5.0	I have also used them with my iPad, and I must say, the tech is so fast to pair	1
7700	5.0	 They sound great, and they look great	1
7701	5.0	Anyone who has an android phone that were considering getting these	0
7703	5.0	It's a set of Apple Air Pods	1
7704	5.0	 If you don't think they are the greatest thing ever, then you obviously hate democracy and eat babies	1
7706	5.0	 I have no use for Apple's overpriced, locked-down stuff	0
7707	5.0	 Wife says these work well, sound great, no issues	1
7708	5.0	 So, you know, there you go	1
7709	4.0	I don’t think the sound quality of the AirPods provide much competition to actual over ear headphones	0
7710	4.0	 However, I do think they make up for it with all the convenience they’ve packed into these little earbuds	1
7711	4.0	 The AirPods are quick to connect to the last device you’ve used them with, and they have pretty good range on them	1
7712	4.0	 I’m able to walk around the office while listening to Spotify without any interruptions	1
7713	4.0	 When I’m not listening to anything, I happily place them back in the charging case the AirPods come with	1
7714	4.0	 I also would like to point out how great it is to be able to charge your AirPods on the go since the charger case is small enough to fit in your pocket	1
7715	4.0	 I’ve used these buds at the gym, in a busy train, and while walking through the bustling streets of Chicago during rush hour without any complaints for sound or noise cancelling	1
7716	4.0	 As I’ve mentioned earlier, they won’t perform better than actual premium over the ear headphones in terms of sound and noise cancellation, but they still perform very well given what’s provided and these small little ear buds	1
7717	4.0	 I would certainly buy these again, and would completely recommend them to anyone who is curious	1
7718	2.0	the sound SOUNDS okay, but it's so quiet	1
7719	2.0	 there's no noise cancelation at all	0
7721	2.0	 the battery life started good and has been rapidly decreasing	1
7722	2.0	 sometimes they won't link to my phone	0
7723	2.0	 sometimes they randomly disconnect	0
7724	2.0	 if I turn the volume down for a second when I turn it back up the volume is still quiet until I put them back in the case for a minute	0
7725	2.0	 then the volume bar is still all the way down but when I turn it up again it gets louder	0
7726	2.0	 same thing if you turn it up accidentally and try to turn it down	0
7727	2.0	 I've only had them for 6 months, and I don't even use them that much	1
7728	2.0	 I had a better experience with 30$ Bluetooth earbuds from home depot	0
7729	2.0	These AirPods have good sound and worked reliably until 2 days ago, less than 2 months after purchased, when they stopped pairing properly, and alternately had sound only from the left, then the right	0
7730	2.0	Messaging contact with Apple Tech Support was an exercise in frustration	0
7731	2.0	 An agent who must have been handling several other calls took an hour and a half to walk us through a procedure that should have taken five minutes, finally arriving at the obvious conclusion that there was a problem	0
7732	2.0	 Then the fun began, eventually preparing to send them back for evaluation, for which I was told at the last minute that they wanted a credit card deposit for more than I paid for them	0
7733	2.0	 The support agent claimed that although the 1-year limited warranty applied to battery issues, it did not apply to connectivity issues	0
7734	2.0	 Doesn't sound right	0
7735	2.0	Surely, Apple could do better than this	0
7736	2.0	 At this point I decided to check on Amazon's return policy and discovered that we are still within the time window for return/replacement	1
7737	2.0	 So that's what we'll do	1
7738	2.0	I've bought lots of Apple products and have been generally satisfied, but maybe I'll be less stuck on the brand in the future	0
7739	5.0	Best purchase of Black Friday 2021	1
7740	5.0	 You don’t need the latest version of AirPods, these will do just fine	1
7741	5.0	 They have a great battery life	1
7742	5.0	 The structure could be slightly better because they do tend to fall out sometimes but no big deal	1
7743	5.0	 Buy it, you won’t regret it	1
7744	5.0	Okay, I am an Apple fan, have been for a while	1
7745	5.0	 I love this second-gen over the 3rd gen	1
7746	5.0	 they fit and feel better in my opinion	1
7747	5.0	 there was only one difference that happened to catch me off guard	0
7748	5.0	 There is no indicator light on the front of this set	1
7749	5.0	 That is not a problem, but it was a slight difference between my 1st set and this set	1
7750	5.0	 They are still my go-to most of the time	1
7752	4.0	These are good AirPods	1
7753	4.0	 Unfortunately, they hurt my ears	0
7754	4.0	 I have bought a total of three of these AirPods	0
7755	4.0	 One for my daughter, one for my boyfriend, and one for me	1
7756	4.0	 They do not hurt my boyfriend or daughter’s ears, so it may just be me	1
7757	4.0	 I do have smaller ears and may be the reason they hurt me	1
7758	4.0	The sound is amazing	1
7759	4.0	 If you are looking for good soundproof earbuds, these are not for you	0
7760	4.0	I had to buy the AirPods Pro for the extra comfort	1
7761	4.0	 The AirPods Pro’s have both amazing sound and soundproof	1
7762	4.0	These are real AirPods, for those who doubt their legitimacy	1
7763	1.0	These AirPods are EXTREMELY flawed	0
7764	1.0	 This is the second pair of second generation AirPods I bought where the microphone completely stopped working	0
7765	1.0	 I now have two pairs of AirPods that do not have a working microphone and I need them to talk with for my work	1
7766	1.0	 Incredibly disappointed with Apple and this crappy AirPods	0
7767	1.0	I just bought the third generation and let’s see if those last longer than six months	0
7768	1.0	First of all it was okay once I received but it kept falling out from my ear	0
7769	1.0	 No worries	1
7770	1.0	 The following day I lost one ear piece	0
7771	1.0	 Oh well I figured I have one to use and listen to music or something	1
7773	1.0	 Couple of days later entirely stopped working and I had to order a new one	1
7774	1.0	 Money well spent for a $120 ear phones	1
7776	4.0	The AirPods are about what you would expect from Apple - spendy, clever, and extremely functional	1
7777	4.0	 Sturdy, comfortable, and convenient wireless abilities allow alot of movement whether working out, skating, or mowing the lawn	1
7778	4.0	 They have never fallen out of my ears	1
7779	4.0	 While there is no real noise cancellation function and sound quality is pretty good	1
7780	4.0	 Where this product really shines, is in the battery charge/recharge ability	1
7781	4.0	After a year: These are still awesome	1
7782	4.0	 There has not been a noticeable decline in charge	1
7783	4.0	 They still last about 2 hours between charges	1
7784	4.0	 The case only has to be charged about every two days	1
7785	4.0	Having tried the air-pod pros, I think these are still more comfortable	1
7786	4.0	Sound quality is still good to excellent	1
7787	4.0	Mic quality is pretty good	1
7788	4.0	Only real drawback is the case has a tendency to collect lint and stuff in the cracks and edges from being in your pocket	0
7789	4.0	Totally still recommend	1
7790	5.0	I bought these airpods a few months ago just because they had the best price on the market	1
7791	5.0	 They arrived as brand new airpods in an apple box	1
7792	5.0	 They are made in California but assembled in Vietnam not China	1
7793	5.0	 The only thing that apple could have improved would've been the battery life	0
7794	5.0	 These are the second generation of the apple airpods	1
7795	4.0	These headphones aren't too bad	1
7796	4.0	 To me the quality is somewhat better than the free headphones you get with your iPhone	1
7797	4.0	 They don't do much to block out sound but that's OK with me	1
7798	4.0	 I have my Jabra wireless headphones for that	1
7799	4.0	 The sound quality is good but not as good as others	1
7800	4.0	 Connecting to your iPhone is fast	1
7802	4.0	 When using them to talk on the phone, the other party says I sound fine and I can hear them well so that's a plus	1
7803	4.0	 I find it difficult to have a conversation using headphones that totally block out outside noise	0
7807	5.0	The set up was fairly easy so far I am enjoying the wireless feature	1
7808	5.0	 I got tired of cords and headphones dying on me way to quickly	0
7809	5.0	 They are fairly secure in your ears once on, not too easy to fall off	1
7810	5.0	 Its worth it to invest in a better pair of headphones that should last	1
7811	5.0	 I did have any issues connecting with the blue tooth connectivity	0
7812	5.0	 I'm very happy with my purchase so far	1
7813	5.0	 I haven't tested the battery life yet though	1
7814	5.0	 So its a 5 for now	1
7815	5.0	So many debate the price and sound quality	1
7816	5.0	 I'm not going to do that	1
7817	5.0	 I know if that is all you care about you can find better	1
7819	5.0	 I have a MacBook, Ipad, Apple watch, and Iphone	1
7820	5.0	 It switches so easy between them	1
7821	5.0	 I use wifi calling a lot and can use any device to do this even when I forget my phone somewhere else	1
7822	5.0	 That is why the easy device switching is important to me and it is faster than previous generation	1
7823	1.0	When I receive them open the box they came just like this looks like they’ve been used and they were broken so only 1 worked didn’t really get to try them out very disappointed	0
7824	2.0	Even though I’m sure to keep my AirPods clean, after a year, so much earwax has been jammed into the AirPods that audio is significantly quieter	1
7825	2.0	 Not worth the money	0
7826	2.0	 No noise cancellation which is pretty standard at the end of 2021	0
7827	2.0	 Battery is great	1
7828	2.0	 The AirPods last for a long time but the case starts to deplete faster as you use them	0
7829	2.0	 The microphone is horrible	0
7831	2.0	 I feel there are better options than these	1
7832	2.0	 If you want to spend some extra money, the AirPods Pro’s are a good choice	0
7833	2.0	 Silicone tips (which would prevent the earwax issue), great noise cancellation, better microphones, recent	0
7834	2.0	 Conclusion is, they’re great for about a year but unless you don’t produce earwax, they start to get quieter	1
7835	4.0	I really like over the head, noise canceling headphones, but it gets pretty hot over the summer in LA, so I can't wear them as often as I would like	1
7836	4.0	 I decided to try the AirPods after several recommendations from my friends	1
7837	4.0	 It doesn't cancel external noise, but they feel weightless and they are incredibly easy to set up	1
7838	4.0	 The battery lasts a decent amount of time and the charging case is small enough that you can keep it in your pocket	1
7839	4.0	 They fit really well	1
7840	4.0	 They don't reproduce low frequencies as well as over the head headphones, but they don't sound bad at all	1
7841	4.0	 A great buy for non-audiophiles	1
7842	5.0	I love my AirPods so far	1
7843	5.0	 I have only had them for a few days but they have been great for listening to music	1
7844	5.0	 The sound quality is amazing and I have had no problems with connecting to my iPhone XS	1
7845	5.0	 They connect as soon as I put them in my ears, which is very convenient	1
7846	5.0	 They connected right away to my iPad with no problem as well	1
7847	5.0	 Battery life is excellent	1
7848	5.0	 No issues with that after hours of listening to music	1
7849	5.0	 So far I love them and am very happy with my purchase	1
7850	5.0	Had Gen 1 and used them everyday for 4 years	1
7852	5.0	 Same function just as good	1
7854	4.0	 I love being able to keep my phone in my bedroom and still being able to go to the bathroom while still hearing my music	1
7855	4.0	 The battery life is really long, longer than I thought	1
7856	4.0	 The case is small and sleek and the AirPods are also small and look good	1
7857	4.0	 They may not work for every ear type, as it fell out of my small ears for a while before I got used to them	0
7858	4.0	 Pretty easy to connect to my iPhone and they sound nice	1
7859	4.0	 I love the features where it stops when you take one out	1
7860	5.0	I love love love these	1
7861	5.0	 Was hesitant to purchase because of price	0
7862	5.0	 Wasted $30 on cheaper version and they lose connection a lot and have to turn phone off and on to re connect	0
7863	5.0	 These have performed flawlessly	1
7864	5.0	 Can set tap control to preference	1
7865	5.0	 I det my right to play/pause and left to skip	1
7866	5.0	 Excellent	1
7868	2.0	Upon buying them, you'll have three more things to keep charged all the time	1
7869	2.0	Supporting software makes it difficult to know precisely how much charge is in either of the three devices	1
7870	2.0	You'll also be constantly worried about losing them	1
7871	2.0	 When you do, Apple will make you pay for the replacement	1
7873	2.0	It's hard to wear them for a long period of time -- they start to hurt your ears after a while, as they are only made of hard plastic	0
7874	5.0	I love the 2nd generation AirPods	1
7876	5.0	I also asked the young members of my staff for their opinion of the newer-generation AirPods; who unanimously endorsed the 2nd generation over the 3rd and 3rd (pro) generations	1
7877	5.0	sometimes, the newest is not necessarily the best	1
7878	5.0	This is like my third purchase of the airpods 2	1
7879	5.0	 I end up giving them to my kids and then buying another pair for myself	1
7880	5.0	 I’m not sure why, but these things seem to sound a lot better than my air pod pros	1
7881	5.0	 The bass is much deeper, producing a sound I appreciate a lot more	1
7882	5.0	 Weird, cuz I always hear the critics complaining about the opposite	0
7883	5.0	 Lucky me I guess	1
7884	4.0	My sister asked me to order these for her	1
7885	4.0	 She seems to like them quite a bit as when she’s home she appears to always have them in	1
7886	4.0	 The sound quality is good, and the battery life appears to be good as well	1
7887	4.0	 Not sure about the noise cancellation feature so cannot comment on that	0
7888	4.0	They didn’t arrive the first time it was “supposedly shipped”, so I had to get a replacement which arrived on the expected date	1
7890	4.0	Loveeee	1
7892	4.0	 I’m starting to question if they are the real Apple AirPods because of the other reviews	0
7893	4.0	 They work well, but they are cheaper than the ones on the apple website and I want to know why	1
7894	1.0	The left AirPod for these won't connect to the charger	0
7895	1.0	 We contacted Apple and they said we had to contact Amazon for them to honor the warranty	0
7896	1.0	 I contacted the Warranty Questions team and they will NOT reply	0
7897	1.0	 Our year warranty date is approaching and this is incredibly frustrating they won't reply and get this taken care of	0
7898	5.0	I was super hesitant to buy AirPods	0
7899	5.0	 I thought they were aesthetically I’m appealing they reminded me of Qtips	1
7900	5.0	 But I ended up actually really loving these	1
7901	5.0	 They charge super fast and they aren’t IN my ear	1
7902	5.0	 Once you open the case they were automatically connected to my phone	1
7903	5.0	 I didn’t have to do any setup	1
7904	5.0	 The cons are they are not noise cancelling and you have to take them out to talk to someone unless you can hear through them	1
7905	5.0	 My bf says they fall out a lot	1
7906	5.0	 I think everyone’s ear anatomy is just different	1
7908	5.0	 Yes, they were noise cancelling and had this cool hear through function but they wouldn’t stay in, especially my left ear	1
7909	5.0	If you buy these make sure when you buy it says sold and shipped by Amazon	1
7910	5.0	 Do not buy from other sellers because you will get fake AirPods	1
7911	5.0	 If you buy from Amazon you will get authentic AirPods for less than you would buy at Apple stores	1
7912	5.0	 These have great sound and great battery life	1
7913	5.0	 Of course, the more you use them the quicker the battery life would diminish	1
7914	5.0	 These are great if you iPhone 7 or greater because there is no earphone/headphone jack and can make it so that you can listen and charge at the same time	1
7915	5.0	 A main reason I got this	1
7916	3.0	I expected to be jumping for joy when I put these pods in my ears	1
7917	3.0	 The sound is fine, not superior to my wired ones	1
7918	3.0	 I tried to adjust volume by asking Siri to lower the volume and her reply was it’s already high	0
7920	3.0	I’m hoping minor headaches are not a permanent part of the joy of using them	1
7921	3.0	I’ll update when things change	1
7922	2.0	I thought I grabbed a good deal but it was too good to be true	1
7923	2.0	At first when I would take the right AirPod out of the case & it would pop up on my notifications, it would glitch as if was unsure if I took it out or not	1
7924	2.0	 an update was giving hoping it would fix the issue but it did not	1
7925	2.0	I ended up putting both headphones on and it sounded like a bad stereo	0
7926	2.0	 The music wasn’t synced	0
7927	2.0	 It was just a hot mess	0
7929	4.0	It’s been about three months since I’ve been using my AirPods and aside from memeing with them on the daily, I’ve enjoyed them a great deal	1
7930	4.0	 They work really well	1
7930	4.0	 the mic transmits my voice well when I call and the sound quality as well as latency is basically the same as using good quality wired earbuds	1
7932	4.0	 One thing I’ve noticed is that the case and AirPods are prone to getting weird dirt particles attached to them and stains are a pain to clean	0
7933	4.0	 They are white after all soooo makes sense	1
7934	4.0	Although the sound quality is really good; around this time I’ve started experiencing weird disconnects and lag	1
7935	4.0	 Like the signal is getting disrupted but it only really happens when I’m on break at work	1
7936	4.0	 At home or when I’m out and about nothing really happens except for a long delay before they sync with my phone	1
7937	4.0	 Battery life seems okay	1
7937	4.0	 I think it’s bothersome how I basically have to always leave the case and pods on a charger or they die when they’re not in use	1
7938	4.0	 The case I kind of get, but I don’t know why the pods get drained when they’re not connected/playing	0
7939	4.0	 Overall I’m satisfied with my purchase	1
7939	4.0	 the slight cons don’t really change much for me since I mainly use them when I’m making commutes from home to work or from my room to the bathroom	1
7940	4.0	 If you’re an apple person or you wanna buy them just so you can be like “sorry; i didn’t catch that airpods	1
7944	3.0	The best thing about these earbuds is how easy they are to use, specifically how they automatically connect to and switch between the devices you’re using	1
7945	3.0	 Can seamlessly switch from iPhone to laptop to iPad	1
7946	3.0	The shortcomings of these earbuds include	1
7948	3.0	 Although the tap controls are customizable, there are some key functions that are missing	0
7949	3.0	 Mute/unmute is the most obvious missing function	0
7951	3.0	 The sound is good, but far from great	1
7953	3.0	 The charging case is very slippery, making it very likely that it will slip out of your pocket	1
7954	3.0	 I lost my first pair of these because the case slipped out of my gym shorts pocket when I sat down	0
7955	5.0	I considered buying the new Air Pod but when I saw that I could get 2 pairs of these for the price of 1 Pro, I ended up doing just that by buying a pair for my wife and I	1
7956	5.0	 While I am sure the noise cancellation feature in the Pros is great, these work perfectly well for our needs, and particularly good and handy for talking on the phone	1
7957	5.0	 My wife and I also used them on a plane and while we could definitely hear engine noise	0
7957	5.0	we were both happy with the sound/quality and even more happy with the price	1
7958	5.0	I have had AirPods since day one, after 4 years the battery went dead	1
7959	5.0	 4 years so that speaks for the value and the endurance of the product	1
7960	5.0	 On top of that Amazon comes in at the absolute lowest price you can find	1
7961	5.0	 Buy them and I promise you will not regret the purchase	1
7962	5.0	Amazon is the the place you want to purchase this product	1
7962	5.0	you will not find a better price or product guarantee	1
7963	5.0	I use it predominantly playing golf, which does stress the limits of the device	0
7964	5.0	 If I move too far from the iPhone it’s linked too, it’ll cut in and out, or off entirely	0
7965	5.0	 It’s not a fair criticism, but it’s my particular use	1
7966	5.0	 It’s also odd, when at a distance, the music will tune in and out depending on the position of my head while putting	1
7967	5.0	 Again, most people won’t care	1
7967	5.0	 if Apple can improve this, it’ll probably help in other situations	1
7968	5.0	 Great sound otherwise and the earbuds are very comfortable over long usage spans	1
7969	5.0	It took me a long time to buy into these wireless earphones	1
7970	5.0	 I had another pair and quite frankly the pairing to the Bluetooth was terrible sound quality wasn’t great and the battery was awful	0
7971	5.0	 I finally broke down and bought these and could not be more impressed	0
7972	5.0	 The sound quality is great and the battery life is amazing	1
7973	5.0	I got these for my daughter for Christmas	1
7974	5.0	 I really wanted to spend less and buy another brand	1
7976	5.0	She wanted the real deal	1
7977	5.0	She LOVES them	1
7978	5.0	 I tried them on and couldn't believe the sound quality	1
7979	5.0	 You can charge the case, she can charge her pods on that case	1
7980	5.0	 Also, she has found a way to track them if she can't find them	1
7981	5.0	 I'm glad I paid the extra for these - the extra price was worth it	1
7982	5.0	 She wears them a lot	1
7983	2.0	I loved them So much	1
7986	2.0	 Then almost 7 months in the left earbud barely has sound	0
7987	2.0	 The sound is so low like a whisper	0
7988	2.0	 I’m so sad	0
7989	2.0	 I spent so much on these babies I should have bought the fricken warranty	1
7991	5.0	Simply a nice upgrade to what I had purchased before	1
7993	5.0	 Charging case with a cable or via wifi	1
7995	5.0	 I just plug the little case in, no issues there and just 1-2 times per week	1
7996	5.0	 These are the first generation and for my ears	1
7996	5.0	 they are fine	1
7996	5.0	 they fit	1
7997	5.0	 I am very happy with NOT spending more and getting such a quality earphone	1
7998	5.0	 They have worked fine for zoom meetings, walking conversations, and for watching movies at home from my ipad	1
7999	5.0	 They easily pop up on your bluetooth screen for whatever device you are using	1
8001	5.0	I had AirPods 2 years ago gifted from friend	1
8002	5.0	 I love the wireless & battery life	1
8003	5.0	 The sound quality & removing one ear to stop it from playing	1
8004	5.0	I just don’t like any other wireless earphones	0
8005	5.0	 My AirPods gave out they been through a lot the past 3 years	1
8006	5.0	 One ear stopped working , I saw this on sale & purchased it last night got it this Morning	1
8007	5.0	 Love it	1
8008	5.0	 Also I got the warranty doesn’t hurt to have protection if one ear fails	1
8010	5.0	 I really like the way the Apple AirPods fit in my ear and they are so light I can hardly tell they are there but they fit snuggly so it would take a lot to dislodge them	1
8011	5.0	 Just be careful taking off a sweatshirt or shirt as they will fall out	0
8012	5.0	These Apple airpods were a Christmas gift for my teenage granddaughter and she told me they are totally awesome	1
8013	5.0	 She uses them all the time	1
8013	5.0	 the noise cancelling feature cancels the family voices right out	1
8014	5.0	 We now have to make monkey motions or stand on our heads to get her attention	1
8015	5.0	 Oh, and the battery life is great	1
8016	2.0	This is my second pair after losing the first	1
8017	2.0	 Why for the love of god do we keep buying this product after losing them easily and they stop working so quickly	0
8018	2.0	 I can’t tell you how many troubleshooting videos I’ve watched for these things	0
8020	2.0	 Apple - be better, your quality has absolutely tanked over the years	1
8021	5.0	For ear buds they're great	1
8022	5.0	 I don't know if it's Apple Music or Airpods but some of the music I've been listening to for years sound a little different	1
8022	5.0	 they're much clearer and the mix is a little different, in a good way	1
8023	5.0	 It's like listening to them for the first time	1
8024	5.0	 you can't use the airpods as a microphone if you want to use it to make videos or speak into your voice recorder	0
8025	5.0	 They won't work	0
8026	5.0	I bough Airpods 3 from Apple directly and returned within a few days	0
8027	5.0	 I was hoping to upgrade from Airpods 2 but they had a terrible fit	0
8028	5.0	 Airpods 2 have a great fit, good battery life	1
8029	5.0	 The sound is okay not that great for music compared to Airpods 3	1
8030	5.0	 But the fit to me is more important	1
8031	5.0	 Airpods 3 causes ear pain and falls off from ear compared to 2	0
8032	3.0	The AirPods them themselves are gen 2 but the AirPods case in gen 1	0
8033	3.0	 To be honest I regret buying them from here I should have bought them from the apple store	0
8035	3.0	 Also the serial number if you search up the serial number on the case it shows up airpods gen 1	0
8036	3.0	for the AirPods themselves it shows gen 2	1
8037	3.0	 Like I just wanna know why would anyone do this especially Amazon	0
8038	3.0	 This is a crazy scam to be honest	0
8039	5.0	Great experience	1
8040	5.0	 Second pair, as the first ever pair I had got destroyed by my washing machine	1
8042	5.0	 Overall great headphones, they're real yes	1
8043	5.0	 Sound great, I wear them at the gym and while working and the battery life has never been a problem for me	1
8044	5.0	 I workout for about 2 hours and they aren't close to dying, and then I put them in the case and I'm good	1
8045	5.0	 Got them on sale for about $100 so it was a good deal	1
8046	2.0	Opened it for the first time and Bluetooth’d to my daughters phone and it says “daddy’s AirPods”	0
8047	2.0	These were told they would be new	0
8048	2.0	 they obviously aren’t	0
8049	5.0	I have the Samsung Galaxy S9, and these pair well with the phone	1
8050	5.0	 Definitely NOT noise cancelling which is fine	0
8051	5.0	 However, I use my Bose Soundsport wireless for the gym and other places where I want noise cancellation	1
8052	5.0	The airpods are not snug in my ear	0
8052	5.0	so far they have not fallen out - though I am hesitant to wear them jogging	1
8053	5.0	 The Bose are better for that	0
8054	5.0	 Overall, a very good product	1
8055	5.0	First, I bought “cheaper” brands because I didn’t want to spend $100+ dollars for headphones	0
8056	5.0	 However-I needed up spending MORE because the Cheap Ones didn’t Work	1
8057	5.0	 So, Finally just ordered these	1
8058	5.0	 WOW, What a Difference	1
8059	5.0	 LOVE that they turn on IMMEDIATELY when u place into your ears	1
8060	5.0	 Sound quality awesome	1
8061	5.0	 Battery life not as long as I’d like~so I bought 2	1
8062	5.0	 Now I ALWAYS have a fresh pair to use	1
8064	5.0	 Don’t make same mistake I did	1
8065	1.0	At the beginning the AirPods were great	1
8066	1.0	 But after 3 weeks the sound got lower and lower	0
8067	1.0	 If I have my phone on medium volumen I can’t hear anything	0
8068	1.0	 I have to have them on high volume to be able to hear the music	0
8069	1.0	 At the beginning it wasn’t like that	0
8070	1.0	 And I have tried other headphones and the other headphones work just fine with my phone	1
8071	1.0	 So I’m sure it’s the AirPods	0
8072	1.0	 I will try to go to the Apple store to see if they can fix them	1
8073	5.0	I think they're great	1
8074	5.0	 I've tried a couple of others trying to save money	1
8075	5.0	 My main purpose is to use them for phone calls	1
8076	5.0	 People that I spoke to with other cheaper models by other manufactures allowed me to hear ok but callers on the other end said the quality was terrible	0
8077	5.0	 With these, people on the other end say that the quality is perfect	1
8078	5.0	 They're great with music too	1
8079	1.0	this set of airpods has never given more than 45 minutes of battery time and now, just over a year of use and I am getting only 20 minutes	0
8080	1.0	 I find that unacceptable	0
8082	5.0	Very good earbuds, I’m very picking about earbuds since some hurt my ears	1
8082	5.0	I’m able to wear these for hours and forget that I am even wearing them	1
8083	5.0	 One problem is that when I first got them they wouldn’t charge and they would randomly disconnect and randomly connect for no reason	0
8084	5.0	 Hasn’t happened in 2 years but it was a problem that is still happening to people that buy these AirPods	0
8085	5.0	 Still highly recommend them	1
8087	2.0	 Would not recommend if you work manual labor	1
8088	2.0	 Thought Apple made good products	1
8088	2.0	 I would recommend getting the cheaper type earbuds	0
8089	2.0	 These didn’t last me 4 months	0
8090	2.0	 Volume just gets lower and lower with each week of use, mic is not working as good either	0
8091	2.0	 Tried to keep them clean every day 	1
8091	2.0	 I can’t stand the fact that I can no longer hear anything add more than what seems to be 25% volume	0
8092	2.0	 Pretty disappointing an apple	0
8094	1.0	First, they don’t stay in my ears	0
8095	1.0	 Second, the case looks like dental floss	0
8096	1.0	 Third, the battery life sucks	0
8097	1.0	 Fourth - and the BUYER BEWARE - is the left AirPod stopped working after 1 month	0
8098	1.0	 “left AirPod not working” it’s been a chronic problem for YEARS	0
8099	1.0	 So far none of the fixes have worked - resetting, restarting device, etc	0
8101	1.0	 The phone says both L and R are charged 100%, but the iPhone podcast app says the left is 5% charged	0
8102	1.0	 Don’t recommend	0
8103	1.0	 Regret the purchase	0
8104	1.0	 If Apple remedies the problem, I’ll revise the review	1
8105	1.0	 They’d be great - if they worked	1
8108	4.0	I like that they don't have a chord	1
8108	4.0	they could be improved by making them easier to stay in my ears	0
8109	4.0	 I'm used to in ear monitors that fit snugly down in my ear canal	0
8110	4.0	 It has taken me a couple of weeks to figure out the best way to put them in my ears, so they don't fall out	1
8111	4.0	 The noise cancellation is nonexistent	0
8112	4.0	 I have some bluetooth headphones that work much better than these	1
8113	4.0	 When I'm wearing these airpods I know if someone is talking to me	1
8114	4.0	 If I want to drown out the noise, I'll have to wear my headphones instead	0
8115	5.0	I lost my last set of Airpods after three years	0
8116	5.0	the battery life was getting bad, so I was happy to buy another pari while waiting for the new Airpod Pro's to be back in stock	1
8117	5.0	I really love these headphones	1
8118	5.0	 They stay in my ears (even while running a 1/2 marathon) and have great sound quality	1
8119	5.0	They charge fast and last for several hours while listening to books podcasts etc	1
8121	5.0	Just don't lose them or it will break your heart	1
8122	5.0	 Luckily I got them quick with PRIME	1
8123	2.0	I've had issues with the right Airpod since I purchased these	0
8124	2.0	 It always dies way before the left Airpod	0
8125	2.0	 I have tried cleaning it and the case	0
8126	2.0	 I have tried repairing the device and all of the other Apple suggestions on what to do when this happens	0
8127	2.0	 Nothing has fixed the problem	0
8128	2.0	 I try charging just the right Airpod at times and my iPhone will say it i fully charged	1
8128	2.0	 I will only get about 5 minutes of listen time before it dies again	0
8129	2.0	 Not sure if I got a faulty pair, but it is really frustrating since I spent so much on these	0
8130	5.0	These air pods are much more comfortable than I imagined they would be and the sound quality is fantastic	1
8131	5.0	 I’m very pleased with this purchase	1
8132	5.0	 I let my hubby check them out and he looked at me and said, “Get me a pair”	1
8134	5.0	 Great bargain	1
8135	5.0	Finally got the AirPods after months of denying the need for it	1
8136	5.0	 If you are a MacBook user and upgrade to any of the iphones post iPhone 6s, you’ll end end up with headphones that work with your phone but not the MacBook Pro	1
8137	5.0	 So annoying, Apple	0
8138	5.0	 So eventually you’ll have to get the AirPods to solve the problem	0
8139	5.0	Now the actual product review - good design allowing the headphones to charge while in the case	1
8140	5.0	 These work best for just about everything except workout and flight travel 	1
8141	5.0	 I've wanted wireless headphones since before airpods became a thing	1
8142	5.0	 These are exactly as promised, and came sealed in a white apple box	1
8143	5.0	 They hold a charge for like 8 hrs of continuous use and I've had them about a month	1
8144	5.0	 I love to take them on walks with me so I can listen to podcasts	1
8145	5.0	 I've used them on phonecalls and haven't had an issue	1
8151	2.0	There is a serious deteriorating bluetooth connection issue with iPhone	0
8152	2.0	 It becomes more and more common after half year of use that iPhone shows the airpods are connected but the sound still goes to speaker; or there is no sounds in either airpods or speakers	0
8153	2.0	 It's unclear what's the issue	0
8154	2.0	 I typically have to try turn the bluetooth on and off several times before it's back to normal state	0
8155	4.0	I am loving my new Airpods, and I do not even have an iPhone	1
8156	4.0	 These are just great headphones and they are so much less expensive than the newest latest and greatest model	1
8157	4.0	One thing I would recommend is to buy those little ear hook things that help the ear bud stay in your ear	0
8158	4.0	 These are especially helpful when using the Airpods for working out/running	1
8159	4.0	Otherwise, the case fits conveniently in your pocket, its lightweight, battery life is great, these are perfect	1
8160	3.0	Have sent in 3 times for repair	0
8162	3.0	 Left AirPod sound muted	0
8163	3.0	 Nothing I have done	0
8164	3.0	 Returned to Apple they “fixed” it but now 2 months later same problem	0
8165	3.0	 Sending back AGAIN	0
8166	3.0	 Ridiculous after spending over $100 on them	0
8167	3.0	 Not worth it in my opinion	0
8168	5.0	the airpods is a no brainer when it comes to wireless earphones if you adopted the apple ecosystem	1
8169	5.0	 I really like the feature where it auto connects to your apple device when taken out and also it remembers which apple device you last listen to and connects to that	1
8170	5.0	 Also the auto pausing feature it has just puts it way ahead of other competitors	1
8171	5.0	 And not to forget the image upgrade it brings to the person wearing it	1
8172	5.0	 Definitely a buy	1
8173	4.0	I bought these AirPods of Amazon, for my daughter’s birthday, She was so happy and excited	1
8174	4.0	 I was a little worried of them being fake or not working properly or anything like that	0
8175	4.0	 But I was completely wrong they work amazing the sound quality is great	1
8176	4.0	 To be able to get both of your AirPods charged equally make sure that your charging case is fully charged	1
8177	4.0	 And then overnight place in your AirPods insider charging case that way you have your AirPods and AirPod Case charge for the rest of the day	1
8178	4.0	 I have not had any technical difficulties so far with the AirPods	1
8179	4.0	 They are very comfortable	1
8179	4.0	 they don’t slip out MY ears	1
8180	4.0	In my opinion these are great	1
8182	4.0	 Love them and would recommend you to buy them	1
8183	4.0	 They also work amazing with phone calls	1
8184	4.0	The sound quality on this is amazing it doesn’t have the best noise cancellation	1
8184	4.0	if someone’s talking to you you probably wouldn’t hear them but sound is amazing and it’s loud enough	0
8185	3.0	These seem a bit larger in the ear than the earphones that come with the phone	0
8186	3.0	 They are tight fitting with no way of adjusting the fit	1
8187	3.0	 Right ear started hurting as the airpod felt like it was pressing against the cartilage of the ear	0
8188	3.0	 Strangely they feel so tight that my ears begin to hurt after 30 min of use, but also they feel like they will fall put of the ear because they are super smooth	1
8189	3.0	 I should have waited for the air-pod pros	1
8190	3.0	 I was going to give these to the girlfriend, but she doesnt even want them	0
8191	3.0	 Do not fall asleep with them, woke up from ear pain	0
8193	5.0	 I’m gonna keep this short so here are the 3 main things I love	1
8195	5.0	 Instant pairing	1
8197	5.0	 Sound quality (phone calls, music, movies)	1
8199	5.0	 Find my AirPods (only works if it’s connected BUT you can still get the last known location)	1
8200	4.0	I like them a lot and get pumped by the music	1
8200	4.0	I have always had a tough time keeping any ear bud or earphone	0
8201	4.0	I always needed the soft silicone pieces to stick	1
8202	4.0	 I don't know if there is a way to get a soft cover over these	1
8204	4.0	Just bought a pair of ear hooks that loop over the ear and NOW I can listen to air pods and enjoy	1
8205	4.0	the sound while I workout or do lawn work	1
8206	4.0	 I wish the ear hooks were around 2 years ago when I first bought them	1
8207	4.0	There's not much bad to say	1
8208	4.0	 They work great, the pod charger thing is a a great idea	1
8209	4.0	Problem is, with careful use, my last pair lasted about 14 months before they just died	0
8210	4.0	 That's way to short a life span	0
8211	4.0	Still, when it comes to usage, it's better than anything like it	1
8213	4.0	 I hate you Apple	0
8214	4.0	 Now take my money, damn you	0
8215	5.0	Ive never been able to find a good pair of rubber tipped headphones that fit or stay in your ear while active so the wired Apple headphones have always worked best for me	0
8217	5.0	 These fit the exact same as the normal wired headphones that used to come with new iPhones	1
8218	5.0	 Good purchase	1
8219	5.0	Love how they fit	1
8220	5.0	 Like that I can listen to one while the other charges	1
8221	5.0	 Never without battery life	1
8222	5.0	 Love the case	1
8223	5.0	 Nice and sturdy	1
8224	5.0	Great for while you’re working you can answer phone calls or send and receive texts with a tap on your ear	1
8225	5.0	 No more digging for my phone just to see it’s a spam call	1
8226	5.0	Extra bonus…got them on sale	1
8227	5.0	These are the real deal Apple AirPods 2	1
8228	5.0	 The headphones themselves are the newer version 2 but the case is just the older style and not wireless charging	0
8229	5.0	 I really didn’t need the wireless charging so I just went with these	1
8230	5.0	 Works great and the battery life is stellar	1
8231	5.0	 I use em all day and only have to charge every couples days	1
8232	5.0	 Would definitely buy again	1
8233	5.0	I almost bought the third generation but had concerns about them fitting or staying in my ears	1
8234	5.0	 These are a great product and the price was far less than on the Apple web site	1
8235	5.0	 They link quickly to my devices and have good sound quality	1
8236	5.0	 They also came on the day I ordered them	1
8237	5.0	 Very pleased with this purchase	1
8238	5.0	They fit well, are convenient, and the battery life is surprisingly long	1
8239	5.0	 I get 2-3 charges from the case which lasts me 2 days	1
8239	5.0	 I literally have my airpods in 24/7	0
8240	5.0	 I am an avid runner	1
8240	5.0	 these stay locked in my ears the entire time	1
8241	5.0	I've had a tiny bit of issue where sometimes (rarely) one airpod won't play anything, but putting them back in the case and taking them out again fixes it	1
8242	5.0	The only downside is that since I have long hair and these are wireless	1
8242	5.0	people will try to talk to me and I won't hear them, giving the impression that I am ignoring people and being rude	0
8243	3.0	Really makes me angry that Apple has proprietary stuff, and then it doesn’t work	0
8244	3.0	 These lasted about 20 months before beginning to have connective issues intermittently	0
8245	3.0	 Now the right one won’t work at all	0
8246	3.0	 So now I’m stuck blowing away another $200 bucks to replace them	0
8249	3.0	 And not the only one complaining about this	0
8250	5.0	In my original review I noted that the airpods are very comfortable and convenient to pair with Iphone and computer	1
8251	5.0	 They seem to be optimized for music, where they sound pretty good	1
8252	5.0	 However, they were problematic for listening to voices on telephone or zoom	0
8254	5.0	 But today I discovered that you can do a custom adjustment on the iphone	1
8255	5.0	 With that I now get voice sound on telephone and on zoom (using the iphone for zoom) that is great	1
8256	5.0	 The only problem is that I can't find any way to get that adjustment when I am using the Airpods with my macbook pro	0
8257	5.0	 Zoom on the mac is very muddy voice	0
8259	5.0	Works perfectly	1
8260	5.0	 Love them	1
8261	5.0	 I wish the tapping controls had more functionality	1
8261	5.0	 I love the look and feel and quality experience of them	1
8263	5.0	 If I lost these I’d buy another set	1
8264	5.0	 I also keep my wired buds and also a cheap Anker wireless buds that give more control over the functions	1
8265	5.0	 They all sound good and all have their uses	1
8266	4.0	I got these for a substantial discount	1
8267	4.0	 So I wasn't expecting them to be wonderful	1
8268	4.0	 The sound quality was excellent	1
8269	4.0	 The noise cancellation was very good	1
8270	4.0	 The battery life was average	1
8271	4.0	 And I have a hard time keeping them in my ears	0
8272	4.0	 But they work and for the kinds of calls that I do, they are sufficient	1
8273	4.0	 But if you want something for exercising or longer listing periods, probably not your best choice	1
8274	1.0	I've tried for two weeks to get used to these airpods	1
8275	1.0	 Bought some silicon covers to help hold them in my ear	0
8276	1.0	 As the silicon warms up, they fall out anyway	0
8277	1.0	 Just slip out without any encouragement	0
8278	1.0	 And even though they don't fit snug enough to stay in my ears, they are miserably uncomfortable	0
8279	1.0	 I wore them for a walk today and five hours later my ears still ache	0
8280	1.0	I liked everything else about these	1
8282	1.0	You can’t hear out of them	0
8283	1.0	 You need to turn the volume all the way up and then the sound is so muffled and you can’t hear it clearly	0
8284	1.0	 Everyone around you can hear a muffled noise also when it’s at the top volume	0
8285	1.0	 My kids would rather use the cheap headphones that come with the phone rather than these	0
8286	1.0	 We tried fixing with tips on Fb and Apple	0
8287	1.0	 Nothing worked	0
8288	1.0	 I bought 2 of these for my kids and they won’t even use them	0
8289	1.0	 So disappointed	0
8290	4.0	I didn't even consider buying AirPods for a while, as there are definitely many more affordable options for bluetooth earphones	0
8291	4.0	 However, I never seemed to be fully satisfied with the other options I tried	1
8292	4.0	 The sound quality is great, they connect flawlessly and I love that it's easy to switch between devices	1
8293	4.0	My only concern is that I have smaller ears and thick, puffy hair	1
8294	4.0	 I sometimes find the AirPods will get loose due to the fit or getting caught in my hair	0
8295	4.0	 Not a deal breaker for me, but I can't see myself wearing them when I'm too active because I'm fearful I may lose one	0
8296	2.0	After the second time I tried them, the left airpod would no longer charge and had to bring them to the apple store	0
8297	2.0	 The apple store representative told me the AirPods were defective and that I needed to contact Amazon to get them replaced	0
8298	2.0	 Talked to Amazon and they are replacing them	0
8299	2.0	 Apple needs to fix this charging issue with the AirPods stems because they don’t last very long or are defective or cheaply made	0
8300	5.0	I have been an Apple fanboy since they came out with iPods	1
8301	5.0	 These little guys are amazingly light weight, sound quality is amazing	1
8301	5.0	 I can have in on for most of the day without worrying about the battery life	1
8302	5.0	 I did not get the noise canceling ones, but with these on I can hardly hear other noises around me	1
8303	5.0	 Must have item in my opinion	1
8304	5.0	My first pair lasted just about a month and the left one failed	0
8306	5.0	I called AMAZON and I had a new replacement within 2 days	1
8307	5.0	 This second pair works great so far	1
8308	5.0	My son has had these for several years and has never had a problem with sound or charging	1
8309	5.0	 He steered me towards this product and I am glad	1
8310	5.0	So much easier to be using the AirPods for phone calls and not having to hold my phone anymore or use the speaker	1
8312	5.0	 Others hear me well when I am conversing with them on the phone while using the AirPods	1
8313	5.0	Very good product, excellent Amazon support for first 30 days or so on this item and then continued support is available through Amazon	1
8314	3.0	I've had my AirPods for about 2 months and I've had some discomfort with the left one	0
8315	3.0	 I figured I'd get used to it and discovered today that I have a small cut inside my ear from an uneven seam on the AirPods	0
8316	3.0	On the plus side, the sound quality is great and I like the functions available through the AirPods	1
8317	3.0	 If you're new to AirPods, take the time to go through the Tips section on your iPhone	1
8319	4.0	 Sound is decent enough for music and podcasts	1
8320	4.0	 Battery life could be a bit better but the case and earbuds charge fast	1
8321	4.0	 Occasionally I have pairing issues with my iPhone 11 but it’s a quick fix when it happens	0
8322	4.0	 Next to no sound isolation so if that’s a priority for you look elsewhere	0
8323	1.0	I've bought two pairs of airpods	1
8324	1.0	 The first was last year for my boyfriend	1
8325	1.0	 They work great and he's never had any problems	1
8326	1.0	 I bought a pair for myself	1
8326	1.0	it would never connect to my phone or charge and I was easily able to return/exchange	0
8327	1.0	 Now I'm on my third pair and they were fine for about 2 weeks, now the left one doesn't charge at all	0
8328	1.0	 Trust me I've tried everything humanly possible to fix it	0
8328	1.0	 I cannot, even when the case and airpods were full charged they died within 2 hours of use	0
8329	1.0	 Of course, the return window ended like 3 days ago	0
8330	1.0	 I really want my money back so I can just buy directly from Apple, these same fake	0
8331	1.0	 Don't waste your money	0
8332	5.0	I’ve wanted a pair of air pods since they first came out but never could bring myself to pay that much for headphones	1
8333	5.0	 Well I’m glad I finally did because these little guys are amazing	1
8334	5.0	 The battery life lasts almost all day for me, the sound is incredible	1
8335	5.0	 They don’t cancel out a lot of noise which is what I wanted anyways since I have kids and need to be able to hear them when they call for me	1
8336	5.0	 I think these AirPods are worth every penny because I use them everyday and I’m in love with them	1
8338	1.0	This is the second pair of air pods ordered	1
8339	1.0	 The right side won’t work	0
8340	1.0	 These were for my teenage daughter	1
8341	1.0	 She spent 2 hours on the phone with 7 different Apple techs to troubleshoot, only to find out that that the serial number on the box doesn’t match the air pods so they couldn’t help her	0
8342	1.0	 They said it the fault of Amazon for mixing up the box with the pods	1
8343	1.0	 We will be returning these	0
8345	5.0	I love my AirPods	1
8346	5.0	 I read all the negative reviews saying there fake but I don’t agree	1
8347	5.0	 the sound quality is good and they sync and work perfectly with my iPhone	1
8348	5.0	 These are not the current generation AirPods but Its not a big deal to me	1
8350	5.0	 If you want current generation AirPods they will cost you more money but they function exactly the same way, not a big difference	1
8351	2.0	I can’t really give a full review on this	0
8352	2.0	 I will say that when I first opened them both pods( left and right) worked	1
8353	2.0	 However, after trying them on a second time	1
8354	2.0	 It seemed that only 1 side would work	0
8355	2.0	 I thought maybe just needed a reset	1
8356	2.0	 After resetting it every way you could possibly imagine	0
8357	2.0	 There was simply no way to have both AirPods work at the same time	0
8358	2.0	 Once I put both AirPods in the case	1
8359	2.0	 The flashing amber lights come on	1
8360	2.0	 I did try to hold the button for 15 seconds	1
8361	2.0	 Still didn't work	0
8362	2.0	 Getting a replacement one sent	1
8363	2.0	 Hopefully this doesn’t have any problems	1
8364	2.0	I bought these expecting a nicely polished product from Apple	1
8365	2.0	 I got the opposite	0
8366	2.0	 They cut out horribly nonstop	0
8366	2.0	 I have tried troubleshooting them from every angle possible	0
8367	2.0	 I am working from home, and spend most of the day on the phone	1
8368	2.0	 These have caused more problems that they are worth	0
8368	2.0	 they're likely going to end up in the trash	0
8369	2.0	 I would not recommend buying these for remote work purposes	0
8370	2.0	 They also amplify strange noises, like quietly opening packages/envelopes	0
8371	2.0	 Sounds like that are amplified through the mic, and are deafening to people on the other side	0
8372	2.0	All that being said, for simple music listening, they work	1
8373	2.0	 The audio quality is so-so, but they work	1
8374	2.0	 It's nice to not have to hassle with cords at the gym	1
8375	5.0	I tried the Samsung Galaxy Buds before these	1
8375	5.0	they didn’t fit my ears well, they pressed on the cartilage in my ears and the sound was not at good	0
8376	5.0	 So I got these and I ave been SUPER happy	1
8377	5.0	 They fit just like the ear buds that come with iPhones	1
8378	5.0	 I use one at a time while listening to podcasts, books, or talking on them to make the battery last longer	1
8379	5.0	I purchased these hoping would hate them and could subsequently return them	0
8380	5.0	 Unfortunately, I immediately loved them	1
8381	5.0	 I would say the cost is justified for the product	1
8382	5.0	 They seem to be a bit more comfortable than the regular apple earbuds, and fit well in my ear even with a daith piercing (regular earbuds did not fit)	1
8383	5.0	 Sound and battery quality is great	1
8384	5.0	 I love that they fit in tiny skinny jean pockets so that I can always have them with me	1
8385	5.0	 As a bonus, I feel like a cool person when walking around with these, as I bought them maybe a year after they became popular	1
8386	5.0	My first wireless earbuds	1
8387	5.0	 I’ve had Apple’s wired buds forever and decided to try the wireless	1
8389	5.0	 Sent them back and got the AirPods 2 and they fit just like the old wired ones	1
8392	1.0	 My boyfriend purchased his headphones from Walmart and we did a comparison as far as how long these things hold charge	1
8393	1.0	 Today I disconnected my headphones early in the morning	1
8394	1.0	 We were both at 100% at 12pm now 8pm and he’s at 80% and I’m at 30% I spent a lot of money on these like everyone else	0
8396	2.0	This product was great, but after about 5 months they stopped syncing to my phone	0
8397	2.0	 I ran every diagnostic test and tried everything the internet and Apple told me to try	1
8398	2.0	 Still nothing	0
8399	2.0	It's obnoxious that products like these are beholden to the one month return window	0
8400	2.0	 That's okay for something like a shirt or mop	1
8401	2.0	 But tech should have a much longer window	1
8402	2.0	Just another reason I stopped buying from Amazon	0
8403	4.0	These are great and comfortable to wear although they have fell out of my ear several times, which is worrisome	1
8404	4.0	 They charge really fast which is a plus and can last a while	1
8405	4.0	 I wish they were a little bit louder although that probably wouldn’t be best if you’re worried about your hearing	1
8406	4.0	 I like the fact that they are cordless	1
8406	4.0	 I wish I could use them while on my laptop	0
8409	5.0	 They sound pretty crisp for the most part, and they embrace bass instead of being allergic to it like some cheaper wireless earbuds	1
8410	5.0	 They charge really really fast too, 15 minutes of charging for 3 hours of playtime	1
8411	5.0	 The experience is seamless, everything works as it should consistently	1
8412	5.0	 Not many earbuds topping these besides the pros of course	1
8413	5.0	 Good buy	1
8420	3.0	Arrived with the left one not working	0
8421	3.0	 So, I ran to my local Apple store	1
8422	3.0	 They had to send it out for repair	0
8423	3.0	 they were delivered back to my home by Tuesday	1
8424	3.0	 So, it was a little frustrating to have them arrive not working, but having them fixed was pretty pain-free and I only had to wait a couple extra days	0
8425	3.0	 I do love my airpods	1
8426	5.0	Sounds perfect	1
8427	5.0	 They are original Apple AirPods in the original box wrapped up in plastic	1
8428	5.0	 Been already using it for about 2 hours and battery life is at same percentage	1
8429	5.0	 Came with a charger	1
8430	5.0	 Easy to pair once I took my iPhone out it automatically asked to pair	1
8431	5.0	Was torn between this one and the Pro model but I’m glad I went with the regular AirPods 2	1
8432	5.0	 They are super comfy and sound quality is plenty good for my liking	1
8433	5.0	 Battery life is superb and I use it everyday	1
8434	5.0	 I don’t have any complaints	1
8435	5.0	 Only con I can think of is that the case can attract all kinds of lint and other things when they are in your pants pockets all day	0
8438	4.0	Please disregard my first review as there was a bit of confusion as to APPLE's warranty	1
8440	4.0	 seller's RETURN policy	1
8441	4.0	 The seller, as it turns out, was never at fault in this case for which I do humbly apologize	1
8442	4.0	 The seller deserves an A+++	1
8443	4.0	 the product itself does not due to the intermittent performance & extremely short reception distance	1
8444	4.0	 I will be relying on the manufacturer's 1 year warranty	1
8445	1.0	These consistently play at max volume for the first 10 seconds they start up	0
8446	1.0	 I am usually good about remembering and let them play super load before they quiet back down to a reasonable volume	0
8447	1.0	 Yesterday I forgot and now I think I have permanent hearing damage	0
8448	1.0	 for over 24 hours I have had a constant high pitch sound in my ear	0
8449	1.0	 I will be going to my doctor tomorrow to talk about the potential damage these headphones did to my hearing	0
8450	1.0	 1 star because it is legitimately dangerous to use	0
8451	5.0	I know some people were concerned that this was a knockoff product	0
8452	5.0	 I received the Airpods in original Apple packaging with serial number	1
8453	5.0	 I am very happy with my purchase as it was exactly what I expected	1
8454	5.0	 Good wireless headphones for everyday use that transfers with easy between my many Apple products (MacBook, iPad, and iPhone)	1
8455	5.0	 That's easily the best part for me, their smooth integration with all other Apple products	1
8456	5.0	 They are not the top of the line wireless headphones for sound quality and features, if that is what you're looking for, but perfect for my daily use	1
8457	5.0	I didn’t want AirPods	0
8458	5.0	I didn’t think they looked good	0
8459	5.0	I didn’t think they would look good on me	0
8460	5.0	Then, my brother got them for me	1
8461	5.0	 And i’ve never been more grateful	1
8462	5.0	 They’re Incredible, they’re so convenient and sturdy	1
8463	5.0	 I’ve dropped them from 4-6 feet plenty of times and they barely even scratch	1
8464	5.0	 I promise you’ll like them once you have them, and if you already want them you’ll be grateful if you do get them	1
8465	5.0	 I even got my girlfriend (who didn’t want airpods) some and she too loves them now	1
8466	5.0	 It’s easily worth the money	1
8467	5.0	I was a little hesitant to get these at first	1
8468	5.0	 I had heard reports of AirPods falling out of people’s ears and getting lost	1
8469	5.0	 I had one of my AirPods fall off on a plane seat	1
8470	5.0	I have not had any other problems with my AirPods	1
8471	5.0	 Siri does require you to speak clearly when making requests, so don’t mumble	1
8473	5.0	I bought these expecting to have an issue with them falling out like standard wired earbuds	1
8474	5.0	 I was wrong	1
8474	5.0	 I have had them over 2 months now and have not had them drop out yet	1
8477	5.0	 The sound quality and background noise elimination were great	1
8478	5.0	The batteries on my original AirPods failed after about a year so I needed a replacement	1
8480	5.0	 These are excellent	1
8481	5.0	 Their device switching is must better than my original pair and the battery life is much improved also	1
8482	5.0	 Comfortable to wear with excellent audio quality and the microphone pick up for calls is unsurpassed in a device this small	1
8483	1.0	Right earplug is discharging to 0% in a charging case if both earplugs are being charging	0
8484	1.0	If I eject left earplug from the case then right earplug starts charging	0
8485	1.0	Support person just walked me through standard script without reading (or understanding) what is my problem	0
8486	1.0	 If it is 0% charged - let me explain how to charge it	0
8489	1.0	 My problem is I cannot charge both plugs simultaneously but there is no script about this and they do not want to listen to me	0
8490	5.0	I bought these from one of the used offers so they were a little bit cheaper, no damages to the box or anything, they were basically brand new, just had to change the name once I paired them to my phone	1
8491	5.0	 They were exactly what I was expecting and I'd definitely purchase again	1
8492	5.0	 Thanks Apple	1
8493	5.0	Made the purchase for my son	1
8494	5.0	 He uses how iPods for social media, music and his virtual learning	1
8495	5.0	 Like any child’s he can sometimes misplace them, cost makes them easier to replace when lost	1
8496	5.0	 The fact that I can replace them if lost or damaged if I add them to my apple coverage with my other devices reduces my cost when they do have to be replaced	1
8497	5.0	 More often then not lower cost items cannot be insured	1
8498	4.0	I loved them at first	1
8499	4.0	 Great integrated design with the charging case	1
8500	4.0	 Super fast linking to iPhone	1
8501	4.0	 They have always been in the house and have never seen any moisture or other contaminants	1
8502	4.0	 The sound quality is quite bad; high end is cut quite a bit	0
8503	4.0	 Often have to reposition the left one in order to balance out the volume	0
8504	4.0	 I was a big fan but can’t stand them now	0
8505	5.0	Love my air pods	1
8506	5.0	 Use them for work everyday	1
8508	5.0	 With wireless ear buds makes everything so much easier	1
8509	5.0	 Love them they look great for a nice case for them to keep them protected	1
8510	5.0	 They last pretty long	1
8511	5.0	 I use one ear bud at a time so they last me all day	1
8512	1.0	After a month of regular use, these AirPods will begin to show faulty behavior	0
8513	1.0	 More often now when taking the AirPods out of the case and putting them into my ears, one AirPod does not work	0
8514	1.0	 So, then I have to constantly place them both back into the case, close the cover, and start over again; or disconnect the AirPods and re-connect them through bluetooth	0
8515	1.0	 This is extremely frustrating and inconvenient when you need them to work	0
8516	1.0	 Apple needs to ensure that their products can perform even basic functions as intended before releasing them to the consumer market - totally useless, defective tech	0
8517	2.0	I'm not sure if these are genuine Apple or not	0
8518	2.0	 I've owned another pair before which work as you'd expect but i bought them from the Apple store when they first came out	1
8519	2.0	 The ones from Amazon don't seem to connect right away and sometimes i have to manually tell it to connect to my bluetooth on my iPhone SE again	0
8520	2.0	 I tried these on my wife's 11 Pro and same thing occurred; it took a long time to connect	0
8521	4.0	Beautiful quality in appearance and function	1
8522	4.0	My ears are too small for these and they became painful after a little while	0
8523	4.0	Then when I didn’t put them in as far to avoid pain I didn’t take them out when I got up and they fell out	0
8526	5.0	 Switched to wireless earbuds a year ago and never looked back	1
8527	5.0	 These work for me and stay in my ears for 10+ mile runs while sweating	1
8528	5.0	 Battery life is great, works with Siri, and range of Bluetooth great	1
8529	5.0	 Haven’t used during cold weather yet	1
8530	5.0	 A lot better than those $40 knock offs I bought first	1
8531	5.0	One time a did experience where only one AirPod was working	1
8532	5.0	 I just turned Bluetooth off and back on, it was remedied	1
8534	5.0	 Haven’t had the problem since	1
8535	4.0	I actually like these earbuds and feel that they fit comfortably in my ears	1
8536	4.0	 I have super small ear canals and the earbuds that fit IN my ears never fit comfortably	1
8537	4.0	 I downloaded an app that enables me to get my calls and to hang up by tapping the earbuds	1
8538	4.0	 I've been pleased with the sound quality and those who are on the other end of my calls have noted that the call quality is really good	1
8539	4.0	 Battery life could be better but overall all this is a good purchase for sure	1
8540	5.0	These things are great	1
8541	5.0	 The hey Siri feature makes them much better than the original version	1
8542	5.0	 I wasn’t a fan of the AirPods Pro with the supposed noise cancelation as they just created white noise and I felt every bump in the road in my ear drums	0
8543	5.0	 So, you get a great product that just works with the base model	1
8544	5.0	 Also, I didn’t see the need for wireless charging as the case lasts a long time and only needs charged two or three times a week	1
8547	4.0	If you're looking for noise cancelling/ sound quality, these are not the right headphones	0
8548	4.0	 I have better quality headphones for the gym	1
8549	4.0	 I wanted these for work and school, to be discrete about my listening	1
8550	4.0	 I didn't want it to be noise canceling because I still wanted to be able to hear people talking to me	1
8551	5.0	Every kind of headphone hurts my ears; over-ear or in-ear, cheap and expensive	0
8552	5.0	 I can’t have them on/in for more that an hour, and even that’s stretching it	0
8553	5.0	 I decided to try these because there was an Amazon coupon, and they are definitely the best I’ve tried	1
8554	5.0	 I can barely feel them in	1
8555	5.0	 And they are pain-free to set up, as in no setup/pairing needed AT ALL	1
8556	5.0	 I love how I can go from listening on my iPad to my iPhone to my Macbook with no complications whatsoever	1
8557	5.0	 Great buy	1
8558	5.0	Bought this pair as a gift for my mom but own my own	1
8560	1.0	The air pods refuse to connect to my iPhone and when it does it’s for a split second	0
8561	1.0	 The second it connects to my phone it immediately disconnects before any sound comes out of it	0
8563	1.0	 Worst experience buying from here, and I am furious about it	0
8564	2.0	So yea my AirPods won't connect to any of my devices and yes before u ask i did reset, repair and try the stuff they tell you to do online	0
8567	2.0	 I'll update if i can get them fixed at the apple store but as of right now its a no from me I'm a bit disappointed	0
8568	1.0	After owning these for less than one year the right AirPod started to sound lower than the left AirPod	0
8569	1.0	 A week later the left AirPod began to sound low as well	1
8570	1.0	 Now, I can hardly hear any sound out of both AirPods	0
8571	1.0	 I have to turn the volume up to the max just to hear out of my AirPods	0
8572	1.0	 I’m disappointed because these AirPods won’t last longer than a year	0
8573	5.0	I'm an office manager so I spend a great deal of time on the phone and typing on my keyboard at the same time	1
8574	5.0	 The airpods work great for me	1
8575	5.0	 I was so tired of trying to hold my phone to my ear by leaning to one shoulder or the other, or putting my phone on speaker, which bothered my boss	0
8576	5.0	 Now I can talk hands free without crimping my neck or making the whole office listen to the speaker phone	1
8577	5.0	 Also, it works great because no one I speak to when using the airpods has to ask me to repeat myself	1
8578	5.0	 They can hear me loud and clear now	1
8580	5.0	These were a Christmas gift for our daughter who was tired of having her iPhone fall and jerk her earbuds out of her ears	1
8581	5.0	 She says these are great and she loves them	1
8582	5.0	 She said she walked quite a distance from her phone without thinking and was surprised that they still worked from that far away	1
8583	5.0	 So, I guess I would recommend them since she’s happy	1
8584	5.0	I chose the gen 2 over the recent releases because the shape of it fits perfect in my ear	1
8585	5.0	 The ones with the round rubber ear piece at the end usually fall out or come loose, but these sit perfect in my ear	1
8586	5.0	 The sound quality is great, super easy to pair with my phone, and those it's not noise cancelling, turning up what you're listening to usually covers it	1
8587	5.0	 Highly recommend	1
8589	5.0	 But I saw these and I knew I had to have them once they came down in price	1
8590	5.0	 They arrived today and they really live up to the name	1

8595	5.0	 Five stars	1
8596	1.0	Back to school time	1
8597	1.0	time to purchase my 5th pair of airpods for my teenager	0
8598	1.0	 Did you know teenagers can lose one or both earbuds with such regularity	0
8599	1.0	 Apple is so smart to sell these to teenagers, knowing they will be repeat customers by default for life	0
8600	1.0	 No, I will not buy the Pro's	0
8601	1.0	 I'm a sucker, but not that stupid	0
8602	5.0	These are the real deal	1
8603	5.0	 I love them	1
8604	5.0	 Didn’t realize I needed them till I started wearing them	1
8605	5.0	I can walk around the house without my phone attached to my hand and carry on a conversation while doing other things	1
8606	5.0	Sound quality on both sides is excellent	1
8607	5.0	Also, they stay put even while jogging	1

8611	5.0	 Great to have both	1
8612	5.0	I wear these every day	1
8613	5.0	 Excellent ear buds	1
8614	4.0	I believe ear pods stretch out your earholes the way your feet stretch out leather slip on shoes	1
8615	4.0	 After using a few days EarPods fell out	0
8616	4.0	 I had phantom pod syndrome and it still felt jammed in even though it was missing	0
8617	4.0	 I think i will have to return to wireless that are wired together as they don't sell replacements	0
8618	4.0	 So I am looking for a left side if anyone is stuck with a half set	1
8620	5.0	 I'm on the phone a lot and the wired earpods were starting to get on my nerves	1
8621	5.0	 Got these at a $100 sale	1
8625	5.0	Great all around headphones	1
8626	5.0	 I use them to work out and they stay in throughout	1
8627	5.0	 Very comfortable to wear for long periods of time	1
8628	5.0	 The sound quality is good as long as your expectations are not that high because these are not noise canceling or over the ear headphones	1
8629	5.0	 If you just need some good wireless headphones with great battery life, comfortable on most ears and sound good get this	1
8630	5.0	I really can’t say enough good things about these AirPods	1
8631	5.0	 I have purchased the “knock off” brands that look similar and have had multiple problems with them	1
8634	5.0	 But after opening the box the AirPods, they immediately were recognized by my iPhone	1
8635	5.0	 The sound quality was probably the best I have ever experienced with earbuds	1
8636	5.0	 I think they are better than a pair of Bose that I used to use	1
8637	5.0	 These are the real deal	1
8638	5.0	 The size of the case is smaller and feels very well constructed	1
8640	5.0	 I am completely satisfied and would recommend	1
8642	5.0	 Go for the AirPods	1

8652	2.0	Very cheap product, it always disconnects and has a hard time connecting	0
8653	2.0	 It’s a noticeable difference that this one is lighter to apple AirPods from the apple store	0
8654	2.0	 Honestly for 100$ this was a ripoff	0
8655	2.0	 So many headphones with way better sound and cheaper that I could’ve gotten instead of these	0
8658	5.0	 The sound quality is great and they pair quite fast	1
8659	5.0	 Great for runs and jogs	1
8660	5.0	 I love being able to do them while washing dishes	1
8663	5.0	 No one ordering who has Amazon prime or is ordering them directly from Amazon is going to receive “fake” airpods	0
8665	1.0	This is my 2nd pair of pods and the 2nd time that something has gone out on it	1
8667	1.0	 Absolute Garbage PODs and Amazon not taking care of Business customers just added fuel to this issue	0

8671	5.0	 The sound quality is better than I expected	1
8672	5.0	 They charge super fast and last for hours before needing a quick recharge	1

8674	5.0	 I can’t wait to travel with them	1
8675	5.0	Got these for my son he loves them	1
8676	5.0	 These are more of a status purchase rather than being the best option available	1

8680	5.0	 But these are a solid buy apple makes a quality product	1
8681	5.0	 Can't go wrong with them	1
8682	4.0	At first I was a skeptic, no way was I paying $160 for a pair of earbuds; wireless or not	0
8683	4.0	 However I jumped on the recent sale and have not regretted it a single day	1
8684	4.0	I have dropped them in water by accident and they still work	1
8685	4.0	 Durable, good sound quality	1
8686	4.0	 Noise cancellation could use work- people around you will hear what you’re listening to	0

8706	4.0	I guess the expensive price is to pay for the apple executives	1
8707	4.0	 First sad that their only in white	0
8708	4.0	 Gets dirty real fast	0
8709	4.0	 There large pods and you have to find the best angle cause after an hour they hurt	0

8725	1.0	One of the Airpods stopped working completely within a month for no reason	0
8726	1.0	 I was a day or two out of the return window and Amazon were the useless money grubbing scumbags they always are and wouldn’t do a thing	0

8731	5.0	 I think it was the phone’s fault (couldn’t get them to ship to the next song)	1
