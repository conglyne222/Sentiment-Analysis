0	0	5.0	Everyone is posting that there isn’t a difference between these and the 1st gen	0.0
1	1	5.0	This is misleading and inaccurate	0.0
2	2	5.0	Is the improvement drastic, no, but it is still an improvement	1.0
3	3	5.0	The improvement is that Apple has upgraded the on-board chip to the H1, which leads to faster and more stable pairing	1.0
5	5	5.0	It’s been tested and proven to be faster	1.0
7	7	5.0	If you already have the 1st gen, then it’s probably not worth the upgrade	0.0
8	8	5.0	If you are looking to buy your first pair of AirPods, then go for these	1.0
9	9	5.0	These AirPods are amazing they automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out	1.0
10	10	5.0	A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward	1.0
11	11	5.0	" To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant"	1.0
12	12	5.0	Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer works with dual beamforming microphones to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency	1.0
13	13	5.0	Additionally, they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time	1.0
14	14	5.0	Just 15 minutes in the case gives you three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time	1.0
15	15	5.0	I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy	1.0
16	16	5.0	These are great but not much better then gen1	1.0

44	44	1.0	So I did some research, tried to reset them, and then I couldn't reconnect them to my phone at all	0.0
49	49	1.0	Apple wanted a $180 deposit to get a new set, which is MORE THAN WHAT I ORIGINALLY PAID FOR	0.0

52	52	1.0	I won't purchase these again	0.0

77	77	1.0	Edit: The second pair just came in and they are absolutely disgusting	0.0
78	78	1.0	If anyone at Amazon looked at these and thought it was okay to ship the product in this condition, I would be surprised	0.0

103	103	4.0	You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device	1.0
104	104	4.0	So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience	0.0
105	105	4.0	Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal	1.0
106	106	4.0	" Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all"	1.0
108	108	4.0	I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information	1.0

185	185	4.0	If I had to buy just one, it would be the AirPods	1.0
187	187	3.0	I was spectacle at first buying these online and not at an Apple store, but they are the newest model of airpods	1.0
188	188	3.0	Unfortunately, the charging case that came with it, is actually the case that comes with the original airpods	0.0
189	189	3.0	The new case has the LED on the outside, not on the inside and the Bluetooth pairing button on the back, is supposed to be in the middle of the case, not any lower	0.0
190	190	3.0	These are the new airpods, however, it came with the old case for the original airpods	0.0
191	191	3.0	Although the 2nd generation AirPods came out in March 2019, improvements are merely incremental	0.0

210	210	3.0	This Apple model has none unless you spring for the newest $250 Pro version	0.0
214	214	3.0	If you haven’t experienced noise cancellation in headphones, or earbuds, you’ll likely be as blown away as I was	0.0

265	265	5.0	The sound quality is decent	1.0
266	266	5.0	I'm no audiophile so to me they sound great	1.0
268	268	5.0	Just keep track of them and you should be good to go	1.0
269	269	5.0	At first they hurt my ears so I bought some silicone covers with wingtips	0.0
270	270	5.0	" They helped the AirPods stay in my ears without moving around and ""softened"" the edges of the earphones"	1.0
272	272	5.0	The battery life is pretty good, and popping them back in the case for 10-15 minutes boosts them almost back up to full	1.0
273	273	5.0	So I'll wear them at work and then if I get up to grab a drink or use the bathroom I'll give the AirPods a quick charge and be good to go the rest of the day	1.0

360	360	1.0	If it wasn’t for all that I would have given a much higher rating	0.0
366	366	5.0	I compared them to the ones that my coworker had bought from apple and they are legit	1.0
367	367	5.0	They were NOT dirty ( I was afraid of that being an issue since I read other reviews complaining about it ) but not my case	1.0

407	407	1.0	Haven’t had them fall out, but when they just hang on your ears the sound is crap	0.0
408	408	1.0	I bought two pairs for my twins and my daughter has complained about using them with amazon music to where it would mess with the singers voice	0.0

420	420	5.0	The battery life is perfect too	1.0

427	427	1.0	Also, when talking to someone on the phone, they would send robotic or they would say I sounded weird and it would stop working and go to the phone	0.0
428	428	1.0	This is the second pair I have owned my first pair my son currently has and has zero issues	1.0

430	430	5.0	these do not live up to the hype	0.0
431	431	5.0	the airpods do not fit in my ears, they don’t have any sort of noise canceling, and the most i’ve gotten out of two pairs is three months of regular use	0.0

440	440	5.0	Being an apple fan, I love these	1.0
441	441	5.0	They are so easy to connect	1.0
443	443	5.0	All I have to do is select them in the list from the device you need them to connect and you are good to go	1.0
444	444	5.0	Another good thing is turning them on/off is easy, just remove them from the charging case and they turn on and put them back to turn them off, its simple	1.0
445	445	5.0	And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device	1.0
446	446	5.0	You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy	1.0
447	447	5.0	Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback	1.0

450	450	5.0	Now the sound quality is crisp and connection is smooth, I found that the 2nd gen AirPods are actually better and improved on 1st gen, but its not worth to upgrade, but if you are planning to get your first one, I would definitely say go for the 2nd gen AirPods, I got a pretty sweet deal on amazon and am very happy with my purchase	1.0

553	553	5.0	but the CASE is in fact the *first generation*, or, the older version of this style of earbuds	0.0
554	554	5.0	That means no light on the front of the case, and no wireless charging	0.0
