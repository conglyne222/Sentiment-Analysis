0	4	 I can't stand the type that push into your ear canal so I was happy to read that these would work with android	1
1	4	 You don't get all the features with an android device obviously but that was of little concern to me	1
2	4	 I don't need to tell Siri to turn up the volume or battery life to be displayed on my screen	1
4	4	 First, they are a bit uncomfortable for someone with smaller ears I guess	0
5	4	 The hard plastic rubs on my inner ear with long usage	0
7	4	 I am also have trouble with them cutting out a bit and sometimes going out of sync when I am using them to stream	0
8	4	 It is worse when I put my phone in my pocket	0
14	5	 Of course, the longer I stayed under water, I realized that the audio was cutting out	0
18	5	 Both AirPods survived the water	1
19	5	 I lived happily ever after	1
20	5	Thanks	1
22	1	 I charged it, precautiousely, so I dont overcharge; and it started working again for another whole week	1
23	1	 Then, on the 4th week of buying this crappy thing, both headphones stopped working	0
24	1	 I know it's not because of overcharging because I definitely took precautions	0
25	1	 It was definitely a faulty product being sold to me	0
26	1	 But that wasn't the good part of this ordeal	0
29	1	 So hurray	0
30	1	 I am stuck with a pair of dead broke $144 Apple Airpods purchased on Amazon	0
31	1	 O, Happy me	0
34	5	 I still don't like anything in my ears, but these are really terrific	1
36	5	 Music sounds crystalline; bass is good, not gut shaking like my stereo system, but still fine; trebble is good as well	1
37	5	Now I've put apps for my favorite classical staions on my phone so I can listen to them sitting on my lanai	1
38	5	 I can also listen to my old iPod which has so much of my favorites on it	1
42	5	ƒ? I normally have trouble fitting silicone seal earbuds in my ears, so the fact that these just sit in the outer ear is actually a plus for me	1
43	5	 Connecting them to my Apple devices (watch, iPhone, iPad) was very easy, and almost instant	1
45	5	For an audio device that doesnƒ??t cancel sound, the sound quality is amazing	1
46	5	 They are probably a little better than the stock iPhone wired earbuds, for reference	1
47	5	 Nothing crazy, but Iƒ??m pleased with them	1
48	5	 Since they donƒ??t cancel sound, I can also wear them around the house or out on walks with my dog without the fear that someone will try to get my attention and I wonƒ??t hear them	1
52	1	 And when Iƒ??m on telephone calls, in the event I would like to listen to media or music or watch YouTube while Iƒ??m on a phone call, they will work perfectly the music media or YouTube will turn down and I can hear the person perfectly	1
53	1	 The second person hangs up the AirPods then go back to not working at all thatƒ??s right I said it folks other than the connect disconnect the sound they do not work at all	0
55	1	 Itƒ??s extremely frustrating I have actually had the opportunity to get a second pair sent to me from Amazon and they work just the same	0
56	1	 I canƒ??t find anything online about what to do my iPhone is brand new so I donƒ??t know why my phones doing this but no one can give me a good answer and frankly I donƒ??t want to anymore because I just wasted a bunch of money on and they donƒ??t work for anything	0
57	1	I am so angry itƒ??s not even funny	0
64	1	 I am furious	0
65	1	 And highly disappointed in amazon	0
66	1	 Wish I could give negative stars	0
67	2	These were fantastic and a game changer for me for the first few months	1
68	2	 But the left pod stopped working recently	0
72	2	 First it took a while for the left to connect	0
73	2	 Then it just stopped working no matter what	0
74	2	 Shows up as green, 100% battery but still no sound ever comes out of it	0
75	2	 Otherwise, I'd recommend AirPods to anyone with Apple devices as they are smart, sleek and convenient	1
80	5	 But these AirPods really beat my expectations	1
81	5	 They are light, easily chargeable and have solid sound quality	1
82	5	 I mainly use it for business calls from iPhone, and this is just magic	1
83	5	 Crystal clear quality, like snowflakes in my ears	1
84	5	 I wish I got them earlier	1
85	5	 The only drawback is a bit weird way to check case charge level	0
87	5	 I find this strange, I wish there was easier and more streamlined way to check it	0
88	5	 At any rate, this is a great product and I do recommend it to Apple fans	1
90	4	 Totally worth it	1
91	4	 They fit really well in my ears and have MUCH better sound quality than any other Bluetooth earphones Iƒ??ve used	1
93	4	 My teen says hers used to last several hours but now only last an hour and the one she used more often now has diminished sound quality	0
94	4	 Iƒ??ve also noticed the diminished quality in the left pod that I use more often	0
95	4	 Even diminished, the sound quality is better than other pairs Iƒ??ve had	1
96	4	 Not as good as the wired apple earphones but I prefer the Bluetooth ones for most of my daily activities as I still manage to get myself caught in the wires and inadvertently fling expensive things to the ground more often than Iƒ??d like	1
97	5	Iƒ??m not exactly sure how long Iƒ??ve had these AirPods but itƒ??s been a long time	1
98	5	 If you take care of them they wonƒ??t let you down	1
99	5	 The only problem Iƒ??ve had it sometimes it doesnƒ??t detect that itƒ??s in my ears and I have to take them out and cover the sensors with my fingers to force it	0
100	5	 I havenƒ??t lost any audio in either pod so itƒ??s still going strong	1
101	5	 The audio is clear and relatively good bass	1
102	5	 For some people they can fall out easily but Iƒ??ve gone running and trail biking and it hasnƒ??t fallen out once	1
103	4	At first I was skeptical in buying this off Amazon and thought Iƒ??d be getting a knock off but I can say Iƒ??m definitely impressed	1
104	4	 I decided to buy 2 pairs of these, one for myself and one for my husband for a Fatherƒ??s Day gift	1
106	4	 This has definitely been a game changer for me	1
107	4	 I love that I am able to connect it to my phone, laptop, and car with Bluetooth	1
108	4	 Itƒ??s great that when I want to figure out what my battery percentage is for both the charging case and AirPods, itƒ??ll tell me on my phone just by opening the charging case and the percentage for both will appear on the bottom of my phone screen	1
113	4	 I love that thereƒ??s a feature where if I do have my headphones on, Siri will read my messages to me and you can send a reply as well	1
114	4	 Siri feature is definitely great for when I am in the middle of something	1
115	4	 Battery life, these havenƒ??t lasted me for an entire day	0
116	4	 I also love that when the AirPods are about to die, thereƒ??s a DUN-DUN noise that plays to let you know put me on the chargerrrrr	1
117	4	 Other than that, Iƒ??m satisfied with my purchase and my husband will love the surprise when he receives it	1
119	3	 They're easy to use, sound decent for music, and they work well for phone calls	1
121	3	 I should have guessed these wouldn't fit me properly	0
124	3	Apple really should offer these in more than one size	1
125	3	On battery life, I was on the phone listening to music and/or the news at a reasonable volume for about an hour, then I was on the phone for about two more hours	1
126	3	 Indicated battery charge went down from 100% to only 25%	0
127	3	" Granted, it's a brand new device, so the batteries might not be quite ""broken in"" yet, but I don't find that impressive"	0
128	3	I'd give these a more of a chance and a longer review, but since they simply don't fit right, they don't work for me	0
130	5	Lets face it these AirPods are by Apple so you know that they are excellent quality	1
131	5	 I absolutely LOVE them and after having them for just one day wonder how I managed without them	1
132	5	 For volume control either have Siri adjust the volume or do it manually	1
133	5	PRO I love the fact that if an AirPod happens to fall from your ear the media that you were streaming will be paused until the AirPod is reinserted, very cool	1
134	5	 I also love that once inserted in ears an on screen charge status shows up, also very cool	1
135	5	 I bough a clear silicone case for the AirPods Charging case as 1- Its very small and slick so could easily fall from hands 2- Better protection in event of contact with water (rain)	1
136	5	 For less than 150 USD you have these marvellous EarPods which is a fantastic buy IMO	1
138	5	 No biggie as to check charge status simply take out & reinsert in one ear & onscreen status appears	1
139	5	 Another con is that there is absolutely no noise cancelling ability whatsoever	1
142	5	 I am quite happy with these EarPods and if you don't need the noise cancelling feature, I'm certain you will be too	1
144	1	 Unfortunately we did not return them in time to receive a refund	0
145	1	 The quality is unacceptable and noting like we would expect from aN Apple product that was purchased from Amazon	0
147	1	 The AirPods purchased at Costco were of superior quality and exceeded our expectations	0
148	1	 The AirPods purchased from Amazon I suspect are likely counterfeit	0
154	5	 Great high fidelity sound quality and they are so comfortable, I forget about them	1
155	5	 I walk most days while listening to NPR news radio or Amazon music	1
156	5	 I also watch news and movies on my PC in my room on Apple wired earphones - but I think I'll switch to using the AirPods from now on	1
157	5	 These are perfect for my needs	1
158	5	 And they were offered at a reduced price on Amazon	1
159	5	 Thank you, APPLE	1
160	5	 Thank you, Amazon	1
161	2	Despite my earlier review of these AirPods ; they turned out to be a piece of junk	0
162	2	 I kept having troubles and sent them back into the Apple Repair center	0
165	2	 They worked for about 2 weeks, now I'm having the same issues as before in that one pod displays a low charge and the other at 100%, they drop off completely and I have to start the sound over again on my I-Pod	0
166	2	 I'm really angry and feel like I've been sold a defective product	0
167	2	 So I will have to deal with the repair center again and go thru that merry go round 	0
168	2	 What a real disappointment these things are	0
169	2	 I'm glad I bought a 2 year warranty, but this is really frustrating	0
170	2	These airpods are not any good	0
171	2	 First, they DO NOT hold a charge that long	0
172	2	 The sound quality is terrible, If you have one in and the 2nd one near by, it's constantly switching automatically	0
173	2	 Unable to hear out of both airpods at the same time either talking or listening to music	0
174	2	 While on a call, you have to damn near scream so that the other person can hear you	0
175	2	 I'm not pleased at all with these airpods	0
176	2	 Lastly, one of the airpods just stopped working	0
177	2	 So, this was a bust purchase	0
180	4	After buying more than a few less expensive earbuds, both wired and wireless, I finally found a pair that satisfies my intense need for great audio	1
181	4	 These fit that need	1
186	4	My only issue with these: You donƒ??t want to run or maybe even walk much with these, depending on ear size	1
187	4	 At 6ƒ??1ƒ??, I have bigger ears, I guess, and a quick tilt of my head can make at least one fall out	0
189	4	Bottom line: Great, clear sound	1
190	4	 Frequency range seems evenly balanced - bass, mid-range and high-end all good	1
191	4	Battery life seems good	1
192	4	Worth the price	1
193	2	While initially enamored of my purchase of the Air Pods, I soon discovered that keeping them or one in my ear was uncomfortable	0
194	2	 I can go for the length of a conversation, but more than that and my ear begins to hurt	0
196	2	 Beyond that, the right AirPod has begun to malfunction, cutting out innumerable times during a conversation despite being fully charged	0
197	2	 I have to manually change the mode back to AirPod each time	0
198	2	 I also am not so taken with the inability to answer an incoming call with the AirPod	0
199	2	" You can ""tap"" it off, I guess, after finishing the call, but one must hunt down one's phone and manually accept the call for the AirPods to work"	0
201	2	 Too good, I guess	1
202	2	 I tried another kind; it lasted for about a day	0
203	2	" Why do these things always claim to be ""improvements'"" but just prove to be less than the initial"	0
206	5	 Enter COVID, these are a lifesaver	1
213	1	Case wouldn't charge	0
215	1	 The airpods easily connected to my phone just as expected	1
216	1	 HOWEVER, the case wouldn't charge	0
217	1	 I plugged it in and waited for an hour and it never went past 30%	0
221	1	 Disappointing tho	0
222	4	These (2nd Generation) AirPods are amazing	1
223	4	 They offer hours of fantastic sound and are a great way to listen to music and jump on a call anytime	1
224	4	 The battery life is pretty solid, giving five hours of listen and talk time	1
225	4	 When you place them into the case, they will automatically charge very fast allowing up to 24 hours of listening time without having to plug them in	1
226	4	 The only downside is the terrible noise cancellation	0
227	4	 It does not offer it as a feature in the product however the lack of noise cancellation is very noticeable	0
228	4	 I have also had some issues connecting back to my phone each time but it is very easy to reconnect, so it's not much of a problem	0
229	4	 Overall, I would say this is a great product and would highly recommend it	1
232	5	 Best decision I have ever made when it comes to my mobile audio	1
233	5	 Airpods deliver great sound quality and fit surprisingly well in many different ear types	1
234	5	 If you have an iPhone, these are the only earbuds you should even be considering getting with built-in optimization in iOS	1
236	5	 Its just too easy to pop out of the case and throw on an audiobook as I run some errands	1
237	5	 Battery life is pretty poor though	0
238	5	 I was on a discord chat and they lasted for just over 2 hours from a full charge	0
239	5	 Yet, it more than makes up for that in its convenience	1
244	5	 Thus, I was wired until Bluetooth came out, and mostly disappointed until AirPods showed up	1
247	5	 I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality for calls, music, podcasts and books, is actually quite good	1
248	5	 As good as my noise canceling Sonys that cost twice as much	1
250	5	 As good as they need to be to keep me happy	1
253	5	 My husband bought me the same pair that I bought my dad and we love them	1
254	5	 I did buy them when they were more expensive so that sucks but I love how if one falls out your music stops playing, you can listen to music, take phone calls, listen to notifications and so forth	1
255	5	 The charging case works great	1
257	5	 You donƒ??t have to charge it all the time which I like as well	1
258	5	 I highly recommend this product	1
259	5	 Excellent price now and I would buy them again for others	1
260	1	Apple is considering the warrenty from the date you ordered and by the time Amazon process it and ships the order its few days (you will be losing a week of so on your warrenty ) 	0
261	1	 Exactly around 1yr time frame our Airpods started giving trouble with low volume after giving run around by both Apple and Amazon, we provided all the proof of receipt etc 	0
262	1	 They told us that they cannot honor the warrenty to get it repaired as they consider the Order date as Warrenty, I wish I would have gove to a physical store to buy 	0
263	1	 Even if Amazon shipped it to you late you will be cheated out of few days so they can get out of providing help 	0
264	1	 Think twice about ordering	0
266	2	 I never expected from Apple that they would not charge, or stop charging	0
267	2	First just the left one stopped charging then a month later both stopped	0
271	2	If we are stuck using these they should have been guarantied for two years	0
276	2	 They are useless now	0
277	2	Apple needs to do better	0
283	5	 Luckily those concerns were misguided as I can say they were definitely worth it (for me personally at least) I no longer have to worry about getting tangled in a cord when trying to do things while listening to music/talking on the phone/etc	1
284	5	 and since theyƒ??re Bluetooth and have a pretty decent range I can leave my phone in one room of the house while I walk around listening to music from the pods	1
285	5	 They also connect with my Apple Watch and allow me to stream music from there on runs where Iƒ??d rather not take my phone	1
286	5	 Iƒ??ve gotten so much use out of them I think they were worth it for sure	1
287	5	I was really hesitant on paying this much for ear buds but after considering I've spent more than this on cheap ones that aren't good I went through with it and I'm quite pleased	1
288	5	 They are tapered so no need for those unbelievably uncomfortable rubber pieces other ear buds have	1
289	5	 They are incredibly comfortable	1
290	5	 I can wear them all day and never miss a beat, versus the thirty minutes tops those ones with rubber pieces that hurt my ears	1
291	5	 They connect almost instantly, no need to try to pair them or anything like that	1
292	5	 They sound fantastic and have a surprising amount of bass	1
293	5	 I work construction and I can hear them over the noise at work	1
294	5	 They last a good four hours and fully charge in 15 minutes	1
295	2	Had to returned after a week because it stopped working	0
296	2	 Purchased another pair in person from an electronic store and I can see the difference and makes me feel this were not the real ones or they were refurbished	0
297	5	I have to say that I just got these AirPods and I LOVE them	1
300	5	PROS: The sound quality is fantastic	1
303	5	 Though I have never owned the first generation of the AirPods	0
304	5	 I like how easy it is to pair these with my iPhone	1
305	5	 It was so quick and simple	1
307	5	 No such thing with the AirPods	1
308	5	 I love the small container that stores and charges them	1
309	5	 It just looks and feel nice in your hand too	1
312	5	 I wish that they were a little more snug in my ear	0
314	5	 Also with the AirPods it doesnƒ??t give me a battery level status at the top of my phone screen	0
317	5	 With the AirPods I have to get the case and open it to get a status of the battery level	0
319	5	I love these AirPods and am extremely happy with them	1
320	5	 I highly recommend these earbuds	1
323	5	 They're great	1
324	5	 They sound pretty good and they just work	1
325	5	 I love that I can make phone calls with them and have Siri at my beck and call whenever I need something	1
326	5	 Also I love that I can use just one at a time, and it can be either the right or left one	1
327	5	 These are well thought out, as most apple stuff tends to be	1
328	5	 Only thing I don't love is the battery life, but I guess what do you expect for things so small	0
333	5	 Nothing I've used works better than Apple Airpods	1
335	5	 Its truly amazing	1
336	5	 If you're tired of having the person on the other end of a phone call tell you they can't hear you very well because there's too much noise then these are the headphones for you	1
337	4	Ok there not Hi-fi, but there pretty darn good	1
339	4	 However, after using them after several flights, I hated the white noise they produced, as well as, the fit just did not work for me	0
341	4	 That being said the AirPods 2 are great for my ears (no white noise) yes they donƒ??t have active noise canceling but I think the sound great for the price	1
342	4	 They also fit my ears perfectly	1
343	4	 Reason for four stars is that as an Apple product who owns beats I expected better highs and mid-tones	0
344	4	 They do have pretty good base for the size of the ear pod and the sound is not blown out	1
347	4	 But they were friendly and did Got it done	1
349	2	The Airpods arrived very fast, clean packaging, ez to pair	1
350	2	 Charged and placed into opn quickly	1
352	2	 Though very cautious, I leaped in	0
354	2	If u r lookn to hear without straining, these ARE NOT the product for u	0
355	2	 No onboard volume adjustments, so phone is dialed up to the max	0
356	2	 TERRIBLE Audibles	0
357	2	Also, the one size fits all earlobs does not work	0
359	2	 Battery seems to be good so far	1
364	5	 Without going into the settings menu your AirPods are automatically synced just by holding them next to your iPhone	1
365	5	 They stop playing music the second you remove them from your ears, you can customize minor commands with the double tap feature	1
366	5	 In earphone usually drop out of my ears constantly but these stay in	1
368	5	 I do have to admit that I wish these AirPods had a little more bass and were 10% louder, but with all the other features and conveniences added together these AirPods are still worth 5 stars	1
370	3	 Sound quality and loudness clearly goes to Galaxy Buds, the airpods just don't do the job	0
372	3	 As for stability (staying in ear) again the Buds have the rubber nipples so they stay put and are comfortable unlike the airpods which after a hour or so leave you with a sharp pain where the edge rest against the inside of your ear	0
374	1	This is one of the purchases where everything that could go wrong did go wrong	0
385	1	 I received the Airpods, and like so many others who have purchased them and left reviews, the left Airpod was defective	0
388	1	 So, because of what was an issue on Amazon's end initially, I'm now screwed out $29 for the AppleCare purchase when I was sent defective Airpods	0
389	1	If you are willing to buy these Airpods after so many reviewers, including myself, provide feedback stating this product is defective, don't waste your money on the AppleCare	0
395	5	 They work great	1
397	5	 They've only fell out of my ears a few times	1
398	5	 The nice thing is that I can switch positions in bed without worrying about the cord	1
400	2	 Like all air pods the battery life and connectivity is great in the beginning and wears down over time	0
401	2	 My 1st gens were all but unusable by the end of their second year	0
404	2	 These have about half the usable range of the first gens	0
406	2	 With these the connection starts to break up when my phone is just one room over	0
409	5	 That aside, these things are amazing and work seamlessly when going back and forth between macbook, iphone, car, etc	1
410	5	 I have been using them for work not that I WFH as a teacher and then enjoy them in the afternoons as well	1
411	5	 Definitely invest in a case right away, I've heard complaints of the case opening up too easily without one plus there are a bunch of fun cases you can get	1
412	5	 When the charging case is charged these guys charge up in 20 minutes no problem from completely dead	1
413	5	 If you don't have apple products I wouldn't spend the money, but the seamless ability to go between all of your apple stuff is 200% worth it if you are already invested and the sound quality is great	1
414	3	Battery life (4 hours) is just long enough for a domestic flight but too short for international flights	0
416	3	I also worry that they'll fall out of my ears on the plane and get lost in the seats	0
418	3	Phone calls are a bit muffled	0
420	3	 They pair automatically but sometimes the left or right channel won't come on	0
422	5	I love my AirPods	1
426	5	 I am happy to report that I have had my Airpods for almost one year and I am just as in love today as I was a year ago	1
427	5	 They are lightweight, super convenient and functional, and I can't seem to live without them	1
428	5	 I recommend looking into Apple Care for any and all Apple products that you are considering to buy	1
432	5	I never thought wireless AirPods one day could be an object I canƒ??t live without	1
434	5	 But I love AirPods just because it is so tiny, invisible, and I get so used to it	1
435	5	 My ears love it	1
436	5	 I love how free I feel with AirPods and unlike other wireless headphones, it is light and chic just as all those regular AirPods I have over many years	1
440	3	I got issues with this device 	0
444	3	 There is no kind of cover to keep the buds clean	0
445	3	Upon first use, after charging, the phones discharged to 71% after only about a half hour of use	0
446	3	 Considerably longer on second use	1
447	3	 Volume level ainƒ??t much	0
453	3	 buds are NOT ƒ??discoverableƒ? under Windows 10	0
455	3	 I can only use these on iPhone, iPad and presumably Mac	0
456	3	 Does not work in Windows 10 and, Iƒ??d bet, Android	0
458	3	 Pretty stupid	0
460	3	(1) they stay in your ear pretty well	1
461	3	(2) they are small and light	1
462	3	(3) they sound pretty good	1
464	3	Probably the worst battery life of any earbuds on earth	0
465	3	I nearly always listen with ONLY 1 earbud in at a time because the other one needs to charge, and I'd rather listen CONTINOUSLY through the day, then have to take both earbuds out and let them charge together	0
466	3	Maybe I need a SECOND pair of these so one pair can charge while I'm wearing the other	0
467	4	To these work well and I like that you can hang up/answer a call by double tapping	1
474	4	 I went ahead and took the leap for the new pro pair & OMG AMAZING	1
476	4	 It literally cuts out sound by at least 80-90% in noise cancellation mode, and with easy tap,	1
478	4	JUST GET THE NEW AIRPOD PRO	1
479	4	 They are comfortable, yes expensive	1
480	4	 almost ridiculous but since using I don't regret buying at all	1
484	1	 So I other words, the new AirPods that would have been in warranty if I bought them from Apple, are out of warranty because Amazon bought them 6 months before I did	0
487	5	Good sound, they fit in the ears and do NOT fall out like corded buds	1
488	5	 The sound is good, but don't expect audiophile level sound	1
489	5	 You can't expect any better than this from tiny little ear buds	1
490	5	 But the essential element to these are the freedom to walk away from your source with NO wires, nothing	1
491	5	 The freedom is the charm here	1
492	5	 That and the apple name make this worth the investment	1
494	5	 But for videos, non serious music listening and whatever else, these are great	1
495	5	 I would say it's better to spend the extra money and get the good stuff, than spend twenty or thirty bucks on some unknown product	1
498	5	It paired effortlessly with my iPhone seven and my older iPad four	1
506	2	 I am now purchasing directly from Apple, these are NOT the latest model, don't be fooled	0
507	5	Overall the airpods are ok, but they're very expensive when you could easily spend the money elsewhere and get somewhat similar quality bluetooth headphones	0
508	5	 Not always does the battery life display on your phone or device sometimes i have to open and close the case a few times for the phone and or ipad to be able to see my device	0
509	5	 It doesnt always connect either, thats another thing I dont like about these things	0
510	5	 Also they can fall out easily from your ears and thats really ridiculous when you're already paying a premium price for the things	0
512	5	 They only costed me like $30 bucks and here im spending much more and they dont even stay in my ears at all	0
513	2	These ear pods are wonderful in quality of sound, ease of use	1
514	2	 I particularly like how you just lift it into your ear and it knows to switch	1
517	2	Downside: Battery life is surprisingly and disappointingly brief	0
519	2	 The buds went dead before the call was finished	0
520	2	Ears are not one size fits all	0
521	2	 I must be careful when using them or they will fall out of my ear	0
522	2	" Having to pay an additional $100 for the ƒ??pro"" model, which is supposed to have adjustable fittings, is a rip off"	0
526	2	""" So, if purchasing these, beware of the fit"	0
527	2	I will not recommend these or purchase again	0
528	5	I wouldnƒ??t call myself an Apple fanboy but their devices simply work, and do the one thing they are designated to do better than any other of its competitors	1
530	5	 One negative thing about is the fact of noise cancellation being almost none existent	0
531	5	 Especially in the subway when the trains are passing by the only sound you hear is the sound of the train and nothing else despite having the AirPods on	0
532	5	 Apart from noise cancellation AirPods blow away any other earpieces Iƒ??ve owned	1
533	5	 With them having discount of 20 bucks I decided to get a pair and they are exactly what I hoped for	1
534	5	 If Apple comes up with a newer model that takes care of the noise cancellation issue I will definitely upgrade	1
535	5	I bought these for my husband for Father's Day and he loves them	1
536	5	 The sound quality is good as well as the battery life	1
537	5	 These ear pods stay in his ears unlike some others that he has tried	1
538	5	 The price was comparable to other web sites that I tried, but I bought them from Amazon, because of the two day delivery and easy returns in case something went wrong	1
539	5	 Nothing went wrong and the hubby is happy	1
540	4	I have to say that I absolutely love the airpods	1
541	4	 They've become an integral part of my life	1
543	4	 They work great for being on the phone, and I prefer them to my car's bluetooth phone system	1
544	4	 The battery life is phenomenal	1
545	4	 I'm just so glad I made this purchase	1
546	4	My only complaint is that when I go for a run they do not stay in very well	0
548	4	 However, during warmer weather when I don't wear anything over my ears I've had trouble with them	0
549	4	 They rarely actually fall from my ears	0
550	4	 However, they generally slide out of place very easily and I have to keep pushing them back in	0
551	1	I have been an early adopter of Apple products and have never been disappointedƒ?? until the AirPods	0
553	1	 I then had trouble getting the other AirPod to connect	0
555	1	 Still didnƒ??t work	0
556	1	 Second issue is the right AirPod frequently does not charge	0
559	1	 When my computer programmer son could not get them to work properly, I knew I got a lemon	0
560	1	 I hear the Pros are better but donƒ??t want to get burned again	0
561	1	 I bought a cheap pair of Edifier buds which work reasonably well and were 25% of the cost of The AirPods	0
562	5	 I was leery of purchasing these based on reviews stating the received used ones but, I am glad I did	1
564	5	I bought these for my 15 year old daughter and she loves them	1
565	5	 They paired easily with her phone She loves the sound quality and they appear to have a good battery life	1
566	5	 She uses her AirPods daily and both sides are still working	1
567	2	This is my second pair (I had the first generation Airpods), and they have the same problem: unreliable charging	0
568	2	 I'll put them in the case, and the orange charging light will come on; I take them out some time later, and one is completely discharged	0
569	2	 I clean them, and still have problems	0
570	2	 Also, sometime they don't register in my ear(s): I need to open and shut the case and insert/remove them to/from my ears multiple times	0
574	1	 One pod was muffled while other pod was fine	0
576	1	 Independently confirmed faulty pod with different iphones of 20-somethings	0
582	1	Between dirt and defective equipment it sure seemed like manufacturer repackaged faulty and/or poor Quality Control	0
583	1	 Not a good look for Mothers Day with family around	0
589	5	 They fit perfectly in your ear	1
590	5	 They pair seamlessly with multiple devices	1
592	5	 These are the bomb and well worth the premium price	1
594	5	 I am amazed that they rarely fall out of my ear so I really don't worry about losing them	1
598	5	 They are great and well worth the price	1

621	5	 There especially good with driving because our state is hands-free now, so I donƒ??t have to be afraid of getting a ticket or whatever for Driving and talking on my cell phone	1
623	5	 These have not broken it all and like I said even though I lost one for a little while, I was able to track it and find it with the find my iPhone app	1
624	5	 They hooked up to my phone super easily literally I open my iPhone and then open the AirPods case and a little thing popped up on my phone automatically that showed it the battery life of these AirPods and connected them to my phone	1
625	5	 It was very easy to do I never had to go to Bluetooth and do anything fancy I did it automatically on my iPhone	1
626	5	 Totally worth the price in a really great buy and Iƒ??m very happy that I got them	1
628	5	 These have not broken it all and like I said even though I lost one for a little while, I was able to track it and find it with the find my iPhone app	1
630	5	 It was very easy to do I never had to go to Bluetooth and do anything fancy I did it automatically on my iPhone	1
631	5	 Totally worth the price in a really great guy and Iƒ??m very happy that I got them	1
633	4	I loved my 1st generation airpods but someone broke my car window to steal them so here I am I keep seeing all these reviews about them being fake and they arenƒ??t 2nd generation but all you have to do is go on check coverage-Apple and type in the serial number and it will literally tell you itƒ??s not an amazon site so you know you arenƒ??t being played by amazon :) mine ARE real and they are 2nd generation	1
635	4	 That was annoying AND maybe itƒ??s the new model or something but the top that you flip open is so loose like really really wobbly and feels fake or cheap idk why Apple would change that or if it has something to do with the loose top I explained either way real product but not what I was expecting hopefully they work as long as my first pair I got from the Apple store	0
637	2	 One earbud refused to charge at all	0
638	2	 The other, even when fully charged, was totally hit or miss when it came to pairing with my new iPhone 12 Pro Max	0
644	5	They're the most reliable wireless earbuds I've come across and you can get applecare with them, which has the best customer service I've come across	1
645	5	 It was a little uncomfortable at first because I have smaller ears but my left ear got used to them and now it feels like I'm wearing nothing	1
646	5	 They pair seamlessly and you really pay for quality and peace of mind	1
648	5	 Now that I have these and the warranty, I know I don't have to go hunting again	1
651	4	They are great headphones	1
652	4	 The sound quality when listening to music is excellent	1
654	4	 I love That they can detect when they are in your ear and when they are not	1
656	4	 These also have a locator on them if you lose them they can give off a siren noise to find them	1
657	4	 They do slide out the ear	0
659	4	 Overall great headphones	1
665	4	) They sound really great--good highs and especially good bass for a pair of in-ear headphones	1
666	4	 And I like the way they fit in my ears	1
668	4	 The connection tends to break up when my phone and the headphones are moving--like if I'm trying to listen while exercising	0

674	5	 Nice, snug and comfortable	1

676	5	 Almost every aspect is perfect for what they were bought	1

680	5	Never intended to use them for music for obvious reasons, but I must say I expected them to sound way worse, than they do	1
681	5	 For an average Joe they sound very decent	1
682	5	 Still if you value sound quality, I would look elsewhere	0
683	5	 These are clearly not for music enthusiasts	0

691	5	 I bought one for everyone in my family from Black Friday and we all have been loving them these past months	1
692	5	 They automatically connect to my phone but if I need I can easily switch to my iPad and laptop within seconds	1
693	5	 Itƒ??s also great that two different AirPods can connect to one phone like if my gf and I want to listen to the same music	1
694	5	 The battery life is a couple hours long and you can fully charge them in the case for less than 20 min	1
695	5	 They last more than a day so all you have to do is remember to charge the case every couple days	1
696	5	 My only personal problem with them is the case is so small	0
697	5	 You definitely need a rubber cover or something because its slippery	0
698	4	I really like the function and sound	1
699	4	 I love to wear while floating in the pool or working in the kitchen	1
700	4	 What I don't like is the comfort or lack of	0
